Something like a strong wind is coming over me
Has got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
Really I shouldn't be

[Pre-Chorus]
One more call
It’s one more “What'cha doing right now?”
It’s one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
One more here we go again

[Chorus]
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I’m not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer

So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don’t bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I’m all alone and picking up the phone

Working like a dog all day, ain’t working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that’d kick the bucket
And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can’t buy happiness

But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I’m sure that’s probably true
But it still sounds pretty cool

‘Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

To float down on the water with a beer…
I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sitting’ on a hundred mill…
Well, that would buy me a brand new rod and reel…

And it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it

Couldn't walk a mile in my new kicks
I'm comin' from the apartments
We never had our damn pool fixed
Walk in the mall with my new bitch
Tell her to get the whole rack
My new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch
Then pull me a new bitch
See that is a snowball effect
I got gold on my neck
Lookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck

I only go for real niggas who don't brag 'bout what they bought me
Cause they know I got a bag, gotta fuck me up some commas
If I fuck and make you cum, you got to promise not to stress me
Don't be blowin' up my phone and don't be leavin' voice messages
Sayin' ""I can do you right, do you better than your exes""
I told that nigga to stop it, he was talkin' out his necklace
See the difference with me, I never needed niggas, ever
I'll leave 'em where I met 'em, I ain't trippin' off no extras
Goons in the cut try to talk you out your necklace
If you ever disrespect me, pussy, don't be disrespectful

He heard about me, he was waitin' on me at the door
I said woo, yeah that mink all on the floor
Used to bust this shit at skatin', 6 to 9, come in at 4

The check is seven figures, I might try and dial the shit
And if I fuck and make you cum, don't be blowin' up my phone
Lately I've been messin' with girls who tend to own shit on their own
I turn dusk into dawn, turn my chair to a throne
Fuck her off in the whip, make her take Uber home
Cold to the chromosome, I grew up without a hammock
I did everything except panic, feel me? Finally Famous the family

Now you wanna say ""What's up?"" to me
Okay, so now you wanna make love to me

[Chorus]
Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me

[Verse 2]
Just be honest, girl, what you want from me?
This ain't nothin' new, keep it so 100
I can't let none of these niggas get one up on me
I go by Gawd Tiller, you better run from me
Give hope to my niggas, them niggas love money
Adios to them bitches, can't get a hug from me
I'm high on life, that's what it does for me
My numbers goin' up, I feel a buzz comin' (One up)

[Pre-Chorus]
Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you ('Cause I'm on nigga)
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers

[Chorus]
Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me

[Verse 3]
This the shit I don't condone in
Cheatin' on your man but you can get it if you want it
Lookin' for a bad bitch, I finally found a culprit
Nigga takin' shots, send 'em back, check the postage, yeah
Hatin' ass nigga, why won't you shut up?
This the motherfuckin' 502 come up
And every time I'm back in the city
Every bitch with a hidden agenda run up (Cause I'm on, nigga)

[Pre-Chorus]
Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you ('Cause I'm on nigga)
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers

[Chorus]
Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me

[Verse 4]
Every nigga did you wrong, except for me
I'm next to blow and so you should've been next to me
Say you lovesick, girl I got the remedy
I'll give you long dick and longevity
Don't settle for less or for infidelity
Niggas ain't built like me
He can't bag and pipe and leave that pussy killed like me
Or even keep the business behind his lips like me
I got a hundred fuckin' problems
Good brain, am I fuckin' with a scholar?
Woodgrain, I'ma grip it when I whip it
If I take a shot and brick it, I'ma flip it
Thankful for my papa, nigga taught me how to get it
Gotta make sure my brothers is eating, I'ma split it
If she throw that pussy at me I'ma hit it
Pen Griffey, but she won't get a penny, no
(Boy, if you don't get!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you ('cause I'm on witcha)
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers

[Chorus]
Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me

509,509,509,Think Of You,Chris Young Duet With Cassadee Pope,"The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.

THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.


THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.

(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)

THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.

THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!

THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?

THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.

(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)

CISSY CAFFREY



I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)

THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.

CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.

(She sings.)

I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)

PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.

PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!

CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)

She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.


(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)

STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.

(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)

THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.

STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.

THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.

(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)

EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.

STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.

(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)

LYNCH So that?

STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!

STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

LYNCH Ba!

STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.

LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?

STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.

(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)

LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.

(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.

Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.

At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)

BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!

(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?

(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)

BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.

(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)

BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.

(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)

THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)

THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.

BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.

(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)

THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)

THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!

(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)

BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?

THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.

BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)

BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)

BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.

(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)

BLOOM O!

(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)

BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.

(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)

RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.

BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.

RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?

BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.

RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?

BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.

RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.

BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.

RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!

BLOOM Mamma!

ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?

(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)

A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!

BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.

(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)

BLOOM Molly!

MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?

BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.

(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)

MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.

(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)

BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...

MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.

BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!

(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)

THE SOAP

We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.


(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)

SWENY Three and a penny, please.

BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.

MARION (Softly.) Poldy!

BLOOM Yes, ma'am?

MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?

(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)

BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...

(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)

THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)

BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?

(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)

THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.

(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)

GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.

BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.

THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.

(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)

MRS BREEN Mr.

BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!

BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...

MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.

(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)

There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.


(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)

BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?

MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!

BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.

MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.

BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?

MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.

BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.

BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.

MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.

BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.

MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.

BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)

ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.

MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.

BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?

MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?

BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.

(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)

RICHIE Best value in Dub.

(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)

PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.

RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...

(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)

RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!

BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.

MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.

BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.

MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.

BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?

MRS BREEN Let's.

(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)

THE BAWD Jewman's melt!

BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?

MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.

BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!

BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.

BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .

MRS BREEN Too.

BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .

MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)

THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.

THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!

(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)

BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.

THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.

(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.

(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)

THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?

THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.

THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!

PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.

PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!

PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.

THE NAVVY (Shouts.)

We are the boys. Of Wexford.

PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?

PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.

THENAVVY (Shouts.)

The galling chain.
And free our native land.


(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)

BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.

(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)

Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)

THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.

BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.

(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)

THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.

(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)

FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.

BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.

(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)

THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.

BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.

(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)

BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.

(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)

SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.

BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.

(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)

SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.

FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.

BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.

FIRST WATCH Proof.

(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)

BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.

FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.

SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.

BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.

(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)

THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.

MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.

FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.

BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.

MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.

BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.

SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.

BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.

FIRST WATCH Regiment.

BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.

A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?

BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.

FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.

BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...

(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)

MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?

(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)

BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.

BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?

BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.

BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.

BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.


BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.

BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.

BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.

FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.

THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!

(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)

SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?

MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.

FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?

MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.

BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.

MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!

FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?

MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.

BLOOM She counterassaulted.

MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!

(General laughter.)

GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.

(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )

(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.

PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.

(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)

(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.

BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)

Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...


(He is howled down.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.

BLOOM A penny in the pound.

(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)

DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.

(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)

BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.

MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!

(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)

THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!

SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.

MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.

(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.

BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.

MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!

BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.

MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.

BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?

BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.

(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.

(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)

THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)

Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo


(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)

THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.

(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)

THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.

THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?

THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.

THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.

FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.

SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.

THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.

(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)

THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)

(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)

LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?

(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)

RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.

(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)

THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!

BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .

HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.

SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!

(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)

PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.

(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)

BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?

PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!

BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.

SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?

FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.

PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.

A VOICE O rocks.

PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.

(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)

FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.

(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.

PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.

(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!

JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.

(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)

PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.

(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)

TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.

(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)

THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!

(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)

BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.

(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)

ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.

BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?

ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?

BLOOM Not I!

ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?

(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)

ZOE How's the nuts?

BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.

ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.

BLOOM Not likely.

ZOE I feel it.

(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)

BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.

ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?

(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)

ZOE You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.

(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)

ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.

BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.

ZOE And you know what thought did?

(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)

BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?

ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?

BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.

ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.

BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!

(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)

THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!

BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...

AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!

(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)

THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!

(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)

LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.

COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.

BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

BLOOM'S BOYS

The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.


A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.

A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!

(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)

A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?

A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!

A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!

A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.

(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)

THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!

ALL God save Leopold the First!

BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.

WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?

BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.

MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!

(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)

THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.

(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)

BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.

(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)

JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!

BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.

(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)

TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.

BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.

THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!

JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.

A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!

AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.

AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.

BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.

(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)

THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)

(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)

THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.

BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!

(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)

THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!

THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS

Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.


(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)


BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.


BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!


THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!


(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)


BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.


(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)


JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.


PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?


BLOOM Pay them, my friend.


PADDY LEONARD Thank you.


NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?


BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.

CHRIS CALLINAN What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of Aldebaran?

BLOOM Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.

JOE HYNES Why aren't you in uniform?

BLOOM When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?

BEN DOLLARD Pansies?

BLOOM Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.

BEN DOLLARD When twins arrive?

BLOOM Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.

LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.

CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.

BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.

ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?

BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.

O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.

DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!

BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.

LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?

(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)

FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.

MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!

MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!

NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.

BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)

I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.
With my tooraloom tooraloom tooralcom tooraloom.


HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.

PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!

BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)

LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!

THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.

BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.

THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.

THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)

(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)

ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!

THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!

(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)

BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.

(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)

DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.

DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.

DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.

(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)

BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.

MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.

(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)

A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?

BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.

BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.

BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.

(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

A DEADHAND (Writes on the wall.) Bloom is a cod. A CRAB (In bush ranger's kit.) What did you do in the cattlecreep behind Kilbarrack?

A FEMALE INFANT (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?

A HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?

BLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.

THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!

(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)

THE ARTANE ORPHANS

You big, you bog, you dirty dog!
You think the ladies love you!


THE PRISON GATE GIRLS

If you see kay
Tell him he may
See you in tea
Tell him from me.


HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.

(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)

MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!

(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)

MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.

BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!

(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)

REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.

THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!

BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.

(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)

THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!

BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.

(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)

THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.

(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)

ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.

BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.

ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.

BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.

ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.

BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?

ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?

BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.

ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.

BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.

ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.

BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.

ZOE Babby!

BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.

THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.

ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.

(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)

THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!

(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)

ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.

BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.

ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.

(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)

KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!

ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)

KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?

LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.

(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!

ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.

(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?

THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!

STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!

THE CAP Bah!

STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .

THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.

STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)

STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!

LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?

ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.

(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)

FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.

KITTY No!

ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!

FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.

(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)

THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.

(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)

STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.

(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)

ALL What?

THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)

FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!

(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)

THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...

(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)

THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?

(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)

ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...

THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.

(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)

THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!

ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.

KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.

ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.

FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.

STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.

(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)

THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.

LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.

(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)

BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.

(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)

MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.

(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)

THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!

(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)

ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?

LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.

ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

LYNCH I'm not looking.

ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?

(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)

VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.

BLOOM Granpapachi. But...

VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?

BLOOM She is rather lean.

VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!

BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.

VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.

VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...

BLOOM With?...

VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.

BLOOM The stye I dislike.

VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.

(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.

BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?

VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!

(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)

BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!

BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...

VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.

BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...

BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.

VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.

I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!


(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)

HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.

(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)

STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.

(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)

ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.

FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.

STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?

FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.

(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)

PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.

PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?

(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?

FLORRY And the song?

STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.

STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.

PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.

ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.

VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!

LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.

ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

BLOOM Poor man!

ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.

BLOOM How?

VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.

KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.

PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?

PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.

(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)

LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.

FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.

ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.

LYNCH Three wise virgins.

VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!

(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.

(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)

THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!

A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.

BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.

HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.

VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!

(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)

THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.

HENRY All is lost now.

(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)

VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!

(Exeunt severally.)

STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.

LYNCH All one and the same God to her.

STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.

FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.

LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.

STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.

(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)

THE CARDINAL

Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.


(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.

(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.

(The trick doorhandle turns.)

THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.

ZOE The devil is in that door.

(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)

ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.

BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?

ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.

(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)

KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.

BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.

(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)

BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.

ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.

(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)

BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.

(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)

BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.

(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)

THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.

BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .

THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.

BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.

THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?

BLOOM Yes. No.

THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)

BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.

THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.

BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!

RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.

BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.

BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.

THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.

BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!

(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)

BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.

THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.

BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?

THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.

BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!

(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)

BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!

BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!

BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!

BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!

BELLO Dungdevourer!

BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.

BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!

BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!

(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)

BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.

BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.

ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.

BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.

FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.

KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.

BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.

BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.

BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.

(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)

BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!

BELLO (Twisting.) Another!

BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!

BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)

BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...

BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.

FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.

KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.

(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)

MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)

BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?

BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!

BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.

ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?

BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.

BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.

BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?

BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...

BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.

BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?

BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.

BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?

BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.

BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.

BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.

BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.

THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?

BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.

(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )

BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...

BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !

BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.

BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!

(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)

BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.

BLOOM Thank you, mistress.

BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!

A BIDDER A florin!

(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)

A VOICE One and eightpence too much.

THE LACQUEY Barang!

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.

BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.

VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.

BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.

BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?

BLOOM Eccles Street.

BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!

BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.

BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.

BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...

BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.

(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)

SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!

BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.

BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.

(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)

MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!

BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.

BLOOM They... I

BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.

BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...

A VOICE Swear!

(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)

BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.

BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?

(He bites his thumb.)

BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!

BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)

BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!

(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)

THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.

VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.

(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)

THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!

BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.

THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.

BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.

THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.

BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?

THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.

THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.

BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.

THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.

BLOOM You understood them?

THE YEWS Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?

BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.

THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!

BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.

JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!

THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.

(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)

THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!

(They cheer.)

BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!

THE ECHO Fool!

THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?

THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?

THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.


THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!

BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?

(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)

STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.

BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.

(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)

THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!

BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)

THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?

(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)

COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...

BLOOM Done. Prff.

THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?

BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.

BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?

(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)

THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.

THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.

(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)

THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!

THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.

THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!

BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.

THE WATERFALL

Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!

THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.

(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)

THE BUTTON Bip!

(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)

THE SLUTS

O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.


BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.

THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!

THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!

BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !

BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.

(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)

BELLA You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.

BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!

BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.

BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!

BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!

BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?

ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.

(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)

BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.

ZOE

Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.


BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.

STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.

ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.

BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?

(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.

LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.

STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.

BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.

STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.

(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)

FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)

BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.

STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.

ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.

LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!

KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)

FLORRY And me?

LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)

STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.

BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.

BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.

ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)

BLOOM This is yours.

STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.

BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.

STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.

BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?

STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.

BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.

STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.

BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.

STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.

BLOOM No, but...

STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)

LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.

STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.

ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.

FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.

STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)

BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?

ZOE Is he hungry?

STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)

Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.


ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.

LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?

ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)

LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.

(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)

FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.

(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)

DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.

ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.

STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE What day were you born?

STEPHEN Thursday. Today.

ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.

FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.

ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?

BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.

BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.

ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.

BLOOM Wrong.

ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?

(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)

BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.

(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)

BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.

ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.

STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?

(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)

FLORRY What?

(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)

THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?

(Bronze by gold they whisper.)

ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.

(They whisper again.)

(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)

LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.

LENEHAN A good night's work.

BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.

LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!

ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.

BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?

BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...

BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?

BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.

MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.

BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!

BELLA What? What is it?

(Zoe whispers to her.)

MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.

BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.

BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.

BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...

KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.

(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)

MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!

LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.

BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!

BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!

BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!

LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.

(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)

SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!

BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?

ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.

BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...

(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)

FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!

SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!

SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.

(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)

MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM

(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!

STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.

BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.

LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.

ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.

(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)

LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous.

Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!

LYNCH Vive le vampire!

THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!

STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.

BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...

STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)

BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...

THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!

STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.

ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.

LYNCH Across the world for a wife.

FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.

STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?

BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.

STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!

BLOOM I say, look...

STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!

(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)

SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!

(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

THE CROWD

Card of the races. Racing card!
Ten to one the field!
Tommy on the clay here!
Tommy on the clay!
Ten to one bar one.
Ten to one bar one.
Try your luck on spinning Jenny!
Ten to one bar one!
Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!


(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)

THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!

GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!

(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)

THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!

(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)

STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!

ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!

PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY

Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...


ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?

BLOOM Who'll.

LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.

STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)

ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.

(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)

ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?

(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)

MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!

(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)

THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.

(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)

MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!

(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)

HOURS You may touch my.

CAVALIERS May I touch your?

HOURS O, but lightly!

CAVALIERS O, so lightly!

THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.

(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)

MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!

(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)

THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!

ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!

MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!

(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)

ZOE I'm giddy.

(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)

MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!

(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)

MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!

THE PIANOLA

Best, best of all,
Baraabum!


KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!

(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)

THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!

(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)

STEPHEN Pas seul!

(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)

THE PIANOLA

Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.


(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)

TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!

SIMON Think of your mother's people!

STEPHEN Dance of death.

(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)

(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)

STEPHEN Ho!

(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)

THE CHOIR

Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...


(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)


BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.


THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.


STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?


BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.


THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.


STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.


THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.


STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.


THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.


STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!


THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.


ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!


FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.


BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.


THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!


STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!


THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)


STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)


BLOOM (At the window.) What?


STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!


FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)


THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!


STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!


THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.


STEPHEN Nothung!


(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)


THE GASJET Pwfungg!


BLOOM Stop!


LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!


BELLA Police!


(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!


(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)


THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.


ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.


BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.


BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?


A WHORE He tore his coat.


BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.


BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...


BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.


BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...


BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!


BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!


FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?


BELLA Do you want me to call the police?


BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.


BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!


BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.


BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?


ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.


BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

THE HUE AND CRY (Helterskelterelterwelter) He's Bloom! Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!


(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)


STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?


STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.


CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.


STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.


VOICES She's faithfultheman.


CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.


PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?


LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.


PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.


STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.


CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.


STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...


PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?


STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.


(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?


DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.


(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)


BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.


STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.


(He staggers a pace back.)


BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.


STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.


BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.


CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.


BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.


CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.


PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?


(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.


(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)


PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.


STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)


My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.


STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...

PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.

BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.

STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.

PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.

STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.

(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)

KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.

(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)

PATRICE Socialiste!

DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.

STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.

BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.

THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.

THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!

A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.

THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)

May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.


THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)

I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.


RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.

(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)

THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.

(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)

RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)

On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!


PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?

STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.

PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?

STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...

(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)

STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?

STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.

CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!

A ROUGH Our men retreated.

PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.

BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.

THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!

(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)

PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.

STEPHEN Did I? When?

BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.

THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!

(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.

PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.

PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.

(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)

CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!

CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.

BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!

STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.

PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.

BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.

CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!

STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)

White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.


VOICES Police!

DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!

(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.

THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Dooooooooooog!

THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Goooooooooood!

(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)

PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!

BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?

LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)

STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.

BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.

STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.

CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.

BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.

PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.

(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!

THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.

THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!

(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)

What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!

THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.

(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)

THE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.

BLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!

PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!

(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)

FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?

PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?

CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?

A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.

BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...

SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?

PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.

BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.

SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.

PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.

FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?

BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.

FIRST WATCH Name and address.

(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)

BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?

FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.

(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)

CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?

FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.

CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?

SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.

CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.

SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.

CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.

BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.

SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.

FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.

BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.

SECOND WATCH It's our duty.

CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.

THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)

BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.

BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!

BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...

(The horse neighs.)

THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!

CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?

BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)

CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.

BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.

CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!

THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.

BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...

(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)

CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.

BLOOM Night.

(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)

BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!

STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...

(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)

BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!

(Murmurs.)

... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...


(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)

BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)

BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!

RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)",46253,10,0.811,0.632,0.323,0.0,0.102,-14.042,0.951,171.053,0.769

And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband

Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man

Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top

And my bitch so bad, she on my Christmas list
'Member I prayed, really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that mad, we taking risks for this
I'm talking risky business, flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm 56
They say I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars
I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
To spit my new verse at your wake while you're lying
The middle of the church have you wake, no I'm lying
I just came from jail, ain't do no crying
They put me through hell, sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and I roared with the lions
Like hold up, from balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble, I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called you collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up
But I did not give up cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game, Philly as shit
Look at these rappers, they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose, came up from nothing
And now they like, ""How he made millions so quick?""

No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right
Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cross off finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

[Chorus]
You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

[Verse 2]
Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last
The best things fly by us so fast

[Chorus]
You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

And a million miles

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done

To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

Til the next big things and already was

Met a man wearin' a t-shirt, says ""Virginia is for lovers""
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said ""All you're really given is the sunshine and your name""
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Verse 2]
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can

[Intro]
Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that

[Verse 1]
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time, she was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?""
Damn…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, ""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick!""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, ""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""

[Chorus]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no

You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Got these racks on me, now it's hard to keep this shit together

Came from the hood now we jump out of states
Peep all these diamonds, they jump out the face
Ducking indictments and selling this white
Got to watch for these niggas they'll jump on your case

And none of this money don't come out the safe
Fuck with my dawg, knock a chunk out ya face
Nigga I be so high, I could jump out to space
What the fuck did I say?

[Verse 2: Future]
I be so fly, just don't shoot my cape
Went and bought me a safe and it came with a Wraith
Got some new money, went and bought me a K

Put that dope in the trap and cook up me a cake
We fly to Cuba to fuck up some mula
Pour up some pour up, my nigga we boolin'
Young nigga pull up in Bentleys just boolin'

Watching my stacks and my shoes

Margielas was cool

We was rocking them Loubs
If I got to lose it's not by the rules
Get hit with that chopper knock right out your shoes
Shawty so proper she look like a goddess
When I dip inside her it's just like a pool
I bought some Rarris and I bought some Phantoms
And then dropped out the seat like I dropped out of school
Still will pull up on you hop out with goons
Thirty-two shots let it pop out the tool

Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight

I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes

To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie, cause undercover
He's gonna save my life like Superman

God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist

And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't leave

They say, ""Build your own""—I said, ""How, Sway?""
I said, ""Slavery a choice""—they said, ""How, Ye?""
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say we 'bout to lose it all
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen they want me sent to mental
We had an incident, but I cover incidentals
You want me workin' on my messagin'
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson
But soundin' like George Jefferson
Then they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again
Then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two, but me and you, that's infinity

For every down female that stuck with they dude

Man I ain’t got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I’m self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I’ll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, last winter was the coldest?
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 3: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don’t panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I’m here today cause I ain't never gave up

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope

Znowu przyszło lato
Ja czekam na stacji
Jest wszystko spoko bo naszły dni wakacji
Czas zrzucić krawat i mieć luz jak Gandhi
Jednego możesz być pewien nigdy nie pożegnam ganji
Ziomek tu podjeżdża zaraz swoim cierpem
Biorę w plecak dużo grassu żeby wrażeń było więcej
Każdy jest już porobiony i podnosi w górę ręce
Nagle zobaczyłem ją
Blond włosy i oczy niebieskie
Jak ją miałem w objęciach to nie chciałem nic więcej
Kiedy tańczyliśmy razem szybciej biło mi serce
Ta plaża to więcej niż miejsce
To wspomnienia i ludzie tak ważni
Powiedz mi Skarbie czy znam Cie jak nikt czy znam Cie jak każdy?

Twoje oczy idealnie pokazują morze
Może pokażesz mi też swoje fobie
Nie wiem czy jesteś prawdziwa lub nie popadam w jakieś pieprzone paranoje
Nie liczy się teraz już nic oprócz Ciebie
Na koniec świata tylko my we dwoje
Każdy pod wrażeniem kiedy mamy splecione dłonie
I idziemy prosto ku słońcu
Ja chce tylko ją i nikogo innego
Choć wiem że wkurza się gdy widzę moje alter ego
I w dupie mam już ten swój kwit
Uwielbiam z nią być kiedy jesteśmy vis-à-vis
I chciałbym z Nią tu być nie liczyć na farta
Choć jej piękny obraz zasłoniły kłamstwa
I taki właśnie jest sezon letni i bawcie się dużo bez żadnych obietnic

Eu acordei como Chris Breezy, oh meu Deus, eu sou o cara
Eu sou tão foda e eu danço bem
Tenho tatuagens no meu pescoço
Acabei de fazer uma vídeochamada com o Kanye
Falei pra ele que sou seu maior fã
Tenho todas essas putas nas minhas DMs
Puta merda, eu tenho uma filha
Ohhh, eu posso cantar tão bem
Me pergunto se eu posso usar a palavra com ""n""?
Espera, eu posso mesmo usar a palavra com ""n""?
E aí, meu negão? E aí, meu negão?
Salve, meu negão, 'tamo aí, meu negão
Seu negão vacilão, cara, fodam-se todos vocês negões
Porque eu sou o negão, negão, negão
Eu sou o negão

[Refrão: Chris Brown]
Eu acordei no corpo do Chris Brown
De alguma forma essa merda virou Sexta-Feira Muito Louca
Mas não temos escolha senão virar essa porra do avesso
Eu não acredito que é uma Sexta-Feira Muito Louca
É, é uma Sexta-Feira Muito Louca
Eu estou no corpo do Chris Brown
Eu dirijo a Ferrari dele e sou um negro clarinho

[Verso 2: Lil Dicky]
(Ring ring) Que porra é essa?
Eu acordei e sou o Lil Dicky
Ugh, que porra é essa?
Essa merda é muito fraca
Como o pau dele fica pendurado nas bolas desse jeito?
Descendo a rua e ninguém sabe o meu nome
Sem paparazzis tirando fotos, isso é ótimo
Ninguém me julgando por ser negro ou pelo meu passado controverso
Eu vou assistir um filme e relaxar
Ayy, eu sou um Blood mas posso finalmente usar azul
Por que a mãe dele fica ligando o tempo todo?
Me deixa em paz, vadia
Espera, se eu estou no corpo do Dicky, o Breezy é quem?
Espero que minha filha esteja na escola
Porra, se eu fosse o Chris Brown, onde eu estaria?
O que eu faria?

Eu olho pro meu pau mole com gosto, é meu pau dos sonhos

[Verso 3: Lil Dicky & Chris Brown]
Se eu fosse o Lil Dicky no meu corpo, onde eu estaria?
Eu tô tentando me encontrar como um monge instrospectivo
Eu tô jogando basquete na quadra, meu Deus eu consigo enterrar
Tirei uma foto do meu pinto
Meu pau tá em tendência no twitter? Caralho
Agora eu estou no club, tentei achar um jeito de entrar
Olho na área VIP, minha nossa, lá estou eu
Eu sinalizo pra ele me deixar entrar mas ele não deixa
Eu não sei quem é esse
Espera, que porra ele pensa que ele é?
Peguei uma garrafa de vidro e quebrei na cabeça do segurança
Andei até o filho da puta
Espera, pense por um segundo
Se você me machucar só vai machucar a si mesmo
Mas espera, eu me amo

Keep it bare, I promise I'll never tear that kitten

So good I might impair that vision
So I dip in then dip off, look for another chick then they pissed off
'Til I give them another spliff then they lift off

I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...

[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

[Spoken Verse 2]
For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines are closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...

[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

[Bridge]
Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""... that guy!"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...

She would get down with somebody I know

In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire (Crossfire)
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's sayin', and she's prayin'

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Verse 2]
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot 'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind

Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves

Died last night in my dreams
Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there was no answer

My heart is a ghost town

Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected
Now, I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight, Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire

And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Ooh, my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

Driving at 90 down those country lanes

And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight

Get it
Text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but never hurting numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout-out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout-outs to all my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
It's time to go, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

Yeah, I sold the pack, the loose, the hard (yeah)
I listened to X, I peeped the bars (yeah)
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
The game's a trap, protect your heart (yeah)
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Skepta]
Uh, she came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My Vans, my braids, my mans, my babes
My girls, my ex, my hoes that I left
The way I stepped out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

[Intro: Kyle + Lil Yachty]
Dostum, sikeyim
Sorun ne Kyle?
Dostum, bu çocuklar, boş boş konuşup sinirimi bozuyorlar
Aga, sikeyim o çocukları, hayatına bak aga, etrafına bak
Dostum.. Haklısın
Hmm, şuradaki sağlam orospuları görüyor musun?
Vay, evet
Şu ağaçları görüyor musun? Peki ya şu suyu?
Sanırım sorun falan yok
Hadi ama kardeşim, şükretmen gereken çok şey var
Aga.. Düşündüm de.. Haklısın
Çok haklısın ki çok haklıyım. Çok haksız olduğum bir gün bile hatırlamıyorum
Sağol Lil Boat, dostum
Kanka, bu yüzden buradayım


[Verse 1: Kyle]
Son zamanlarda kafayı bulmuyordum...
Pekala, belki biraz bebeğim, yalan söylemek istemiyorum
Bana mesaj attığında, kızım, her zaman cevap vermiyorum biliyorum
Sen bir melek değilsin, uçamıyorsun bile
Fark ediyorum ki, bir şeyler bildiğini sanıyorsun
Tüm bu hayaletler bana doğru geliyor, kimin fırlattığını merak ediyorum
Vizyonu göremiyorlar, dostum dikkatlari dağılmış olmalı
Bu gerçekten güzel bir albüm ahbap, kim yazdı merak ediyorum, oh lanet olsun
Tamam, o zencilerin gitmesini diliyorum
Cirque Du Soleil gibi her zaman etrafta palyaçolar var
Bu bir albüm değil, hatta bunlar sadece gelişi güzeller
Bu şey çok soğuk, piyasaya sürüldüğünde kar günü olacak
Ayy, o iyi ve bunu biliyor, söylemiyor, sadece gösteriyor
Ben tıpkı DeRozan gibiyim, shoot atarsam girer
Cali'de güneşleniyorum, onlar o kadar ıslanıyor ki kızağa ihtiyaçları var
Oprah ile selfie'im var, sadece paylaşasım yok
Mutlu mekanımda takılıyorum, 2006' dan beri somurtmuyorum
2001' den beri ağlamıyorum, benim mekanım Six Flags gibi ve senin evin
Hiç eğlenceli değil
Benimkine geri de gelebilirsin, arkadaşın tatlı değil
Fakat sorun değil
Yüksek notada bitireceğiz

[Chorus: Kyle]
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver

Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh ben...

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
21 yaşında olduğunu söylüyor, kimlik görmem gerek
Bütün orospularım çift çift geliyor aşağıdaki taşaklarım gibi
Bir Hatchback'te şehri turladığım günleri hatırlıyorum
Genç goblinlerimle bir sorun arıyoruz
Modelimi evine boynundaki ağrılarla gönderiyorum
O kadar çok para kazandım ki durdurulamıyor
Kardeşlerim soyadım gibi yanımdadır
Herkese evcilleşmeyeceğimi söylediğim zamanlar aklımda
Woah, altı ay sonra ters döndüm ve şimdi oyundayım
Sahte zincir kolyelerden bambaşka seviyelerde elmaslar
""Beni buradan alabilir misiniz?"" sveiyesinden buraya geldim
Beni siklemeyen bir sürü insanı hatırlıyorum
Üniversiteye gittiler, şimdi hepsi tarih oldu
Dişimdeki altını elmasa dönüştürdüm
Arabamızda sert takılıyoruz, gizemli şeyler peşindeyiz (Raggy!)
Beni siklememeye devam et
Uzun zamandır lüks içinde yaşıyorum, hayır
Boat ve Kyle piyano tuşları gibi birbirinden ayrılmaz
Anneannemin üstüne yemin ederim ki asla bir orospuyu kondomsuz sikmem

[Chorus: Kyle]
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver

She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 2]
Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn’t call her, ""Hoe"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram

Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift a hand

Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

Pointed at the sign hanging up on the wall

But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?

Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late

Drown inside my vices all day

(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all

Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong

And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

[Intro: Darell & Ozuna]
Wo-oh
Oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Wo-oh, yeh (Yeh-yeh)
Este e' el verdadero remix, ¡baby! (Na-na; ¡ey-ey-ey!)
Eso e' así (Ozuna)
Paso mucha' noche' pensándote
Yo no sé ni cómo ni cuándo fue (Eh)
Pero sólo sé que yo recordé (Eh-eh)
Cómo te lo hacía yo aquella vez (Oh-oh)
Sí, yo no puedo seguir solo (Jeje)
Pero sé que te boté (Pero sé; que te boté)

[Estribillo: Ozuna]
De mi vida te boté, yeh, y te boté (Oh-oh)
Te di banda y te solté, yo te solté (Y te solté; oh-oh)
Pal' carajo usté' se fue, y usté' se fue (Na-na)
De mi vida te boté, yo te boté; yeh, yeh, mami (te solté; Ozuna)

[Verso 1: Bad Bunny]
Baby, la vida e' un ciclo (Wuh)
Y lo que no sirve yo no lo reciclo (No)
Así que de mi vida muévete
Que si te lo meto e' pa' recordar un T.B.T., yeh (Yeh)
Ya yo me cansé de tus mentira'
Ahora hay una má' dura que me tira (Yeh)
Todo tiene su final, todo expira (Yeh)
Tú ere' pasado y el pasado nunca vira
Arranca pal' carajo, mi cuerpo no te necesita (¡Wuh!; no te necesita)
Lo que pide e' un perreo sucio en La Placita
No creo que lo nuestro se repita
Dale, prende un Phillie, deja uno ready pa' ahorita, yeh (¡Brrr!)

[Pre-Estribillo: Bad Bunny]
Odio saber que en ti una ve' má' yo confié
Odio to' lo' ""Te amo"" que mil vece' te texteé
Baby, mejor que tú ahora tengo como die'
Lo nuestro iba en un Bugatti y te quedaste a pie

[Estribillo: Bad Bunny & Darell]
Yo te boté; te di banda y te solté, yo te solté
Pal' carajo te mandé, yo te mandé
Y a tu amiga me clavé, me la clavé (Esta e' la verdadera vuelta, ¿oíte'?)
Fuck you, hijo 'e puta, yeh (¡Wuh!)

[Verso 2: Darell]
Bebé, yo te boté (¡Ja!)
Y desde que te di esa' botá' la' gata' son de tre' en tre' (Eso e' así)
Si tú quiere' pregunta si no me cree' (Baby)
Que ya no tengo estré'
Pa' completar las filas son express (¡Ja-ja!)
Tú vi'te como el mundo se te fue al revé'
Y yo con ella en R.D. (Jaja-jaja)
Que me enamoré el día que la probé
Yo ya no creo que vuelva y te de
Mami, porque el servicio te lo cancelé
Si no respondo (¡Ja!) el problema va a tocar fondo
Mami, respira hondo mientra' te lo escondo (Eso e' así)
Contigo obligao' hoy yo me pongo el condón
Pero posteao' a media cancha, baby, como Rondón (¡Ja!)
Yo a ti te di una sepultura dura (Eso e' así)
Yo sé que con el tiempo la herida se cura (Por ley)
E' que en verdá' que tú no está' a esa altura (¡Ja!)
Te lo juro por Dio' aunque por Dio' no se jura
(¡Ra-ta-ta-tá!)

[Estribillo: Darell, Nio García & Casper Mágico]
Bebé, yo te boté (E' que bebé yo te boté)
Te di banda y te solté (Y te di banda y te solté, pa' que sepa')
Pal' carajo te mandé, eh, eh (¿Tú me estás entendiendo lo que te estamos queriendo decir?, Pal' carajo te mandé)
De mi vida te saqué, eh, eh (Esta es la verdadera vuelta, nosotro' somos Los Mágicos, bebé, Real G4 Life, ¡Casper! ¡hey!)

[Verso 3: Casper Mágico]
Pal' carajo te boté (Wuh, pal' carajo te boté)
Yo sin ti me siento bien (Ah, yo sin ti me siento bien)
Ya no sufro por amore', ahora rompo corazone'
Y sobran las pacas de cien (Sobran las pacas de cien)
Tú me rompiste el corazón (Me rompiste el corazón, ¡wuh!)
Sin sentido y sin razón (Sin sentido y sin razón, ah)
Pero tengo un culo nuevo que me da mucho cariño
Y me chinga bien cabrón (Uh, chinga bien cabrón)

[Estribillo: Casper Mágico & Ozuna]
No te lo voa' negar que te sufrí, la pasé mal
Pero te superé y de mi vida te boté (Yo te boté)
Y te di banda y te solté (Y te solté)
Y de ti no quiero saber (Quiero saber)
Y pal' carajo te mandé; hoy me voy a beber (Me voy a beber, Ozuna)

[Verso 4: Ozuna & Nio García]
De mi vida te boté y yo sé que no ere' cualquiera
Me pasaré la vida entera preguntando a dónde fue
Pero tu amiga me textea siempre que ella me desea (To' los día')
Se tira una foto conmigo y me dice ""Pa' que tú la vea'""
Prendo pa' ver si me olvido
De tu nombre, de tu' beso', tu cuerpo, tus gemido' (Oh)
Lo hacíamo' en el carro, me gritaba al oído
Cierro los ojo' y pienso en todo lo que hicimo', baby (Oh)
Prendo pa' ver si me olvido
De tu nombre, de tu' beso', tu cuerpo, tus gemido' (Oh)
Lo hacíamo' en el carro, me gritaba al oído
Cierro los ojo' y pienso en todo lo que hicimo', baby (Oh, ¡Nio!)

[Verso 5: Nio García]
Yo te di confianza y me fallaste
Te burlaste de mí y me humillaste
Lejo' de aquí te fuiste y ni explicaste
Viste mi película y viraste
Ahora quiere' saber lo que pienso de ti
Me siento cabrón porque no estás aquí
Así como viniste tú te puedes ir (Te puedes ir; ¡uh-yeh!)

[Estribillo: Nio García]
No te voy a negar que te sufrí, la pasé mal
Pero me superé y de mi vida te boté, y te boté
Te di banda y te solté, yo te solté
Pal' carajo te mandé, yo te mandé
Y de mi vida te saqué, yo te saqué
Bebé, yo te boté

[Verso 6: Nicky Jam]
Miento si digo que no me hace falta cuando me rozaba tu piel
(Cuando me rozaba tu piel)
Miento si digo que no me hace falta que llames al amanecer
(Llames al amanecer)
Pidiéndome que te agarre bien duro en la cama y te haga mi mujer
(Y te haga mi mujer)
Aprovecho el remix con Ozu' para mandarte pal' carajo también
(Para mandarte pal' carajo también)
No quiero mentira' ni tu falsedad
Me voy pa' la calle esta noche a rumbear
Me bebo do' trago' y te voy a olvidar
Me voy con las babies que quieran jugar
No quiero mentira' ni tu falsedad
Me voy pa' la calle esta noche a rumbear
Me bebo do' trago' y te voy a olvidar
Me voy con las babies que quieran jugar

[Estribillo: Nicky Jam]
Bebé, yo te boté, te boté
Te di banda y te solté, yo te solté (Solté)
Pal' carajo te mandé, yo te mandé
Y de mi vida te saqué, yo te saqué (Yo te saqué)

I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror

But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Without no coat I was walkin' and meditatin' in the rain
Reminiscing about bein' in prison, I was locked in them chains
Without no drugs I was workin' and stimulatin' my brain
I ain't gotta act how I was actin', everything done changed
I was missing out on plenty shit, just watchin' time fly past
I was broke, down on my dick, I had to get me a bag
Havin' shootouts broad day and we was runnin' from task
I put my flex down, never sit down, I told that bitch I'll never stand down
Creepin' on your block with a hundred rounds
Go to shoot and try to run
Hop out the whip and we gon' run you down
Shoot him dead up his head, knock off his dreads
Now he can't make a sound
Kill him where he stand, we live by law and we gon' lay it down
Tell me he want smoke, 187, that's that same shit
.357 send you to hell, knock out your brain quick
Sippin' on this drank, RIP Fredo, this that bang shit
Doin' the same thing, time pass, got a bitch with a fat ass
I told her turn around and bust it open
That Soulja Slim, that C Murder, come in the tank just like a No Limit soldier
I'm poppin' X so I'm steady rollin'
Say he a gangster, got his chest out
When I hit him with this Glock I bet I fold him
None of these niggas ain't never play with me
Play with me, I bet you see
Fuck that Twitter beefin', you want beef, I pull up where you sleep
Bitch I'm out the North, 38 Baby, I come from the streets
Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in
People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again
Bitch I'm screamin' fuck it, never change, thuggin' to the end
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for?
Why they steady sayin' they gon' snatch my chain though?
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (shoot 'em up yeah, yeah)
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (fill 'em up yeah, yeah)
Overdose, I kill 'em slow

You ain't got no bodies, you ain't 'bout it, boy you are not a stepper
You play with me, bitch ain't no hidin', ain't nobody can help you
Send your ass to the devil, in an envelope like a letter
Got an FN with a clip with different colors up in it

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

[Verse: Kanye West]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb

What harm could come from one little call

Girl you're takin' too long

To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time

Rip it off just like a Band-Aid

I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him

[Verse 2]
I know you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove

So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time

Rip it off just like a Band-Aid

But I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him

The only thing that mattered to me was our love
Never will I stop, I'll never get enough

Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Gravel dust behind the wheels
Drifting like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cutting cross the sky
I'm rolling through the open wide
Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to

[Chorus]
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

[Verse 2]
Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here trying to get untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel

[Chorus]
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer

First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be ballin' on these niggas, got me feelin' like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many things I ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit, crown by the toilet
I'm just barely gettin' started, you already upset
Got a tiger as a pet, I just took him to the vet
Homie, I be makin' hits, I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me like she was on the feeder
If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout features, homeboy, you's a peon
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you gettin' peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold, I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set, just in case they wanna sleep on, ya dig?
I'm a full-time player, hoppin' out in alligator
Sippin' lean and Now and Later, homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle, you gon' have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her, I would never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely gettin' love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fuckin' with me
I be killin' this shit, pray to God they forgive me
They said, ""when you blow up, don't forget me"", man
I been on fire ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on ya, homie, I ain't talkin' diapers
Walk into your function, on point, I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexin' all you want but homeboy, you ain't ready
Ten times sharper than Michael Myers' machete

I ain't talkin' pancakes, but he flip a brick fast
A bunch of bad bitches, ain't doin' the dab, bitches
Do be in some gangs, couple Cs on their bag, bitches
Fuck you mean? Fuck your little memes
Even Queen Bey had to tell 'em I'm the queen
Check the D, blessed indeed
The executive producer, bitch, rest in peace
Then he put his hands in my pants, felt them thick lips, and got wood
He said, ""Kylie, wuss good?"" I said, ""Miley, wuss good?""
I said, ""Could you pay my bills, like O'Reilly? Wuss good?""
I just sit back and observe, all these niggas that I done curved
If it go down in your DM, then baby boy, you lucky
Cause 99.9%, of these fuckboys can't fuck me

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I seen your man post a quote, and a pic in bed
So I hit him in the DM, like, ""Hey bighead
'Member when I was your woman crush?"", He said, ""Yeah""
Told him that I'm headed home, he could meet me there
Try to beat me there, let me be clear
Is you eatin' ass too? Nigga, pinky swear
I'm just lookin' for a dude, that could eat the twat
Do he make more dough, than the pizza shop?
Do he dress every day, like it's Easter Sunday?
Can he give me more head, than Peggy Bundy?
Man, fuck I look like turnin' down some dome?
Man that's sorta like a dog turnin' down some bone
Nigga know that I'm a 10, that's Celine on my lens
I don't need another friend, it's just me and my Ms
I said, ""What you like about me?"" He said, ""That your ass fat""
He said, ""Would I let him eat this ice cream out my ass crack?""
He said that, ""It's abstract"",He said, ""Yo, yo ass crack!""
I told him ""I never front"", and then I threw that ass back

It go down in the DM (it go down, it go...down)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)

Kick the dust up, c'mon

All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)

[Verse 2]
Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody

Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up

Fill your cup up

And kick the dust up (c'mon)

Y'all be glad you did (kick it)

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody

Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song

Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up

You've been drinkin' and drinkin', you're drinkin' for fun
And you drink for a reason
Yeah, leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leavin'

I'm signin' new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimmin' with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixin', this shit like the Catalina

I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it, I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favorite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up

Niggas got me throwin' bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feelin' generous, throwin' my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, ""Bingo!"" the minute I'm bonin'
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the mornin'
Got Xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, grippin' it, backin' me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwin'
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinkin' Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, droppin' that ass to a split
Talkin' 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whippin' the bricks, huh

[Couplet 1 - Halsey]
Il a dit qu'il a essayé de me téléphoner, mais je n'ai jamais le temps
Il a dit que je n'écoute jamais, mais je n'essaie même pas
J'ai eu un nouvel endroit à Cali, mais je suis parti tous les soirs
Alors je le remplis d'étrangers pour qu'ils restent allumés
Elle a dit qu'elle vous a dit qu'elle me connaît, mais le visage ne va pas
Elle a demandé si je la reconnaissais et je lui ai dit que ça serai possible

[Pre-Refrain - Halsey]
Tu peux voir, partout où je vais
J'ai un million de personnes différentes qui essaient d'être avec moi
Mais je suis toujours seul dans mon esprit, oh

[Couplet 2 - Big Sean]
Unh, regarde
Je suis un vrai individu rare
Je suis dans le physique et le métaphysique (ouais)
Je sais que vous avez besoin de votre temps seul, c'est essentiel
Mais j'ai besoin de votre temps, est-ce que je suis hypocrite?
Tu sais que je peux relier avec vous plus qu'avec ma famille
Donc je ne vais pas m'asseoir et te laisser couler dans les sables mouvants
Je sais que vous avez des plans de millions de dollars
Et vous essayez de construire une marque, vivre une vie en forte demande
Détourant des grands Bs, votre sac a des petits Gs
Gucci jusqu'aux chaussettes comme Biggie et Little Ceas
Allons aux Maldives et cachons-nous derrière des palmiers
Petit vin rouge, mauvaise herbe et une brise calme
Car bébé, tu vis la vie à l'intérieur d'une bulle
Quand était la dernière fois que vous avez eu quelqu'un qui vous embrasse?
Quand était la dernière fois que vous avez eu quelqu'un qui vous aime?
Quand était la dernière fois que vous avez aimé quelqu'un qui vous aime?

Rester debout et m'avoir toute la nuit sur le support
Vous savez que nous disons, j'ai la conversation la plus méchante
Tu me dis toujours, dis que je suis pleine d'attitude
Et tu n'aimes pas mon amie parce qu'elle est grossière
J'arrive dans le Benz avec tout en or
Fenêtre en bas parce que vous devez me voir avec mon roi
Qu'est-ce que tu sirotais, je trempe, maintenant tu pars d'une aventure
Je vais couper votre aile, tadah

[Intro]

[Hook: Missy Elliott]
Shorty what?
The dance that you doing is dumb
How they do it where you from?
Stickin' out your tongue
Girl, but you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun
That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
I'm so faded, no exaggeration
Backs breakin' like a percolation
Boys to the yard for some hip spankin'
Where you make it drop down like you in the matrix
Can't take it, them chicks been fakin'
Y'all still sleep, better stay awakened
Hot new dance for the hood to make it
Make the donk move fast, make them think you drinkin'
Head to the floor don't collect that though
You better huddle up cause the beat's so cold
Pop that, pop that, cock and reload
This another hit, I got an ace in the hole
Boys on my back, playa did you peep that?
You got a small stack, playa, you can keep that
I'm a Big Mac make you wanna eat that
Like m-m-m-m-m, yak it to the yak
Junk in the trunk make you pumps in the bump
Girls wanna have fun make you stickin' out your tongue

[Hook: Missy Elliott]

I come into this bitch like liquid
Drip, drip, then the business
Click, click, get your picture
Hermés Trismegistus
Witness and get lifted
Basic, nigga I was born in the basement
Shape shift, nigga I think like a spaceship
False, oh-nah-nah-nah
I am so different than y'all, so far apart
The way that I balance the bars
I never fall, and if I do I just call
The almighty yellow star, God
Lyrically I'm Optimus Prime
The car I drive, look far I ride
When I go by, smoke in your eyes
So open your eyes, the joke's on you guys
And you ain't gotta be a mason to see through
Some of this shit on occasion

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I'm like kak-a-rak-a-rak-rak-a-rak-a-rak
Make a new track, make 'em fall on they crack
Give 'em a slap, appetizer and smack
I'm so fat in the back, make the boys all collapse
Yeah when I rap they be all on my jack
Boys wanna jump on this pussy cat
Got a new idea, let me switch it
Man, I'm so futuristic
Big lips and big, big, big hips
Body be thick like a biscuit
Different, rippin' shit, microphone grippin' it
Gettin' these Benjamins, new car, whippin' it
Uh, I'm so far ahead of ya'll, man I'm on top of the stars
I don't care none of you are, blah-blah-blah-blah

And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good.""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it.""

I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did

I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?

Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Droppin' bottles, spend, I'm supplyin' ten
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern

And it match the Lambo too and I'm coming with the crew
This is Team 10, bitch, who the hell are flippin' you?
And you know I kick them out if they ain't with the crew
Yeah, I'm talking about you, you beggin' for attention
Talking shit on Twitter too but you still hit my phone last night
It was 4:52 and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too, don't make me tell them the truth
And I just dropped some new merch, and it's selling like a god, church
Ohio's where I'm from, we chew 'em like it's gum
We shooting with a gun, the tattoo just for fun

Can I have a moment before I go?
Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
Cause I still care, do you still care?

Well I grew up in a real town
Where the prom queen had a plastic crown
And we really did just drive around
Cause there wasn't shit to do

We drank RC, no real Coke
Our neighbor had a pool

We got a dive bar with a real band
They play too loud and they're real bad
But we're real bored so we still dance
And we stay out way too late
Hit the Waffle House for some real food
But that waitress, she's real rude
She got real problems, but we do too
So we tip her anyway

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can hear the drummer drummin'
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone
I know something's comin'
But I'm runnin' from it, to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was?
Was it too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens?
‘Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
‘Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin, even if it means I'm sellin' my soul
Just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
‘Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that? I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark
This sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out
And I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
‘Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here
But I'm not a quitter; gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
‘Cause you're moving onto the next, but is your respect gone?
‘Cause someone told me that…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't give me that sob story, liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features
And try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be
A fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback, as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage, and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em
‘Cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say!
It just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent-up rage, ‘cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
‘Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies, they just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck
You’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope, all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again
All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
Or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm
And launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go
I'm still not leaving, stop for no one, I don't know
But I've been told, an obstacle that blocks your road, ya
Knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, ‘cause…

[Bridge: Eminem]
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky!
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
‘Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

[Verse 4: Eminem]
So you're tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus, I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness; kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas
Still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen
But Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat, ‘cause makin' the beat
Ain’t the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that sound-bombing, thirstin' howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God, just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time

You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

[Chorus]
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

[Verse 2]
Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleepin' with someone
And sleepin' with someone you love
""I love you"" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind

[Chorus]
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind (Yeah)

[Outro]
When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin', don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line

Half your life you struggle
Half your life you fly
Half your life makin' trouble
Half your life makin' it right
One day I'm the exception
Most days I'm just like most
Some days I'm headed in the right direction
And some days I ain't even close

I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone

Burning man

I always loved the highway
I just don't run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still don't get it right sometimes
I just don't get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah, but now I don't stay near as long

I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone

Maybe I'll go to the desert
Find myself in the Joshua Tree
If we pass in the night then just hand me a light
And tell me you burned just like me

Wenn ich die Bananen schäle hat das nichts mit Chimpansen zu tun
Ich hab diesen Bitches zwei Jahre gegeben, jetzt ist eure Zeit um

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight

Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say

949,949,949,What The World Needs Now Is Love,Broadway For Orlando,"I flew to Hawaii recently to shoot a film, fresh on the heels of being labeled a homophobic bigot by Andrew Sullivan, Anderson Cooper, and others in the Gay Department of Justice. I wanted to speak with a gay-rights group that I had researched and admired, so I called its local Honolulu branch.

The office number turned out to be some guy’s cell phone. I left him a message—I said, “I’m from out of town, I’m visiting Hawaii on business, I’d like to  get some information on your group.” After two or three more calls, he answered the phone. I said, “Yeah, I’m the guy that called about your organization.” And he said, somewhat impatiently, “Okay, well, what did you want?” I said, “Well, let me put it to you this way, Nick. Your name is Nick? Nick, let me begin by asking you a question. Who would you say, by your estimation, is the most homophobic member of the entertainment industry currently in the media?” And he paused for a long count of four and said, “Um … Alec Baldwin?”

And I said, “Ding, ding, ding, ding! Bingo, Nick, bingo! That’s who you’re talking to.”

He said, “C’mon!”

I said, “Nick, I want to come in and talk.”

I met with Nick and others from two LGBT organizations. We talked for a while about the torment of the LGBT life many of them have lived while growing up in traditional Hawaiian families. Macho fathers. Religious mothers. We talked a lot about words and their power, especially in the lives of young people.

One young man, an F-to-M tranny, said, “Are you here to get dry-cleaned, like Brett Ratner?” Meaning I could do some mea culpa, write them a six-figure check, go to a dinner, sob at the table, give a heartfelt speech, beg for forgiveness. I thought to myself: Beg for forgiveness for something I didn’t do?

I said, “No. I don’t want to get dry-cleaned. I don’t want to be decontaminated by you, Karen Silkwood–wise, scrubbed down. I want to learn about what is hurtful speech in your community. I want to participate in some programs about that. Or underwrite one. And then, like you, I just want to be left alone.”

I’ve read where a number of people have felt that 2013 was a shitty year. For me, it was actually a great year, because my wife and I had a baby. But, yeah, everything else was pretty awful. And I find myself bitter, defensive, and more misanthropic than I care to admit. And I’m trying to understand what happened, how an altercation on the street, in which I was accused—wrongly—of using a gay slur, could have cascaded like this. There’s been a shift in my life. And it’s caused me to step back and say, This is happening for a reason.

I’ve had a relatively charmed life. I loved to be out in the city. New York was my town. I’ve had people come up to me and say, “You’re a great New Yorker. You’ve given your time and money to so many New York charities. You’re a great supporter of the arts. I like some of your movies—and some of your movies suck, actually.” (It’s New York, so people give you their unvarnished opinion.) But people in general had been very kind to me for years.

And then, last November, everything changed.

Am I a homophobe? Look, I work in show business. I am awash in gay people, as colleagues and as friends. I’m doing Rock of Ages one day, making out with Russell Brand. Soon after that, I’m advocating with Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Cynthia Nixon for marriage equality. I’m officiating at a gay friend’s wedding. I’m not a homophobic person at all. But this is how the world now sees me.
I haven’t changed, but public life has.

It used to be you’d go into a restaurant and the owner would say, “Do you mind if I take a picture of you and put it on my wall?” Sweet and simple. Now, everyone has a camera in their pocket. Add to that predatory photographers and predatory videographers who want to taunt you and catch you doing embarrassing things. (Some proof of which I have provided.) You’re out there in a world where if you do make a mistake, it echoes in a digital canyon forever.

And this isn’t the days of Rona Barrett and Ron Galella, who were viewed as outcasts or peripheral at best. Paparazzi today are part of a network that includes the Huffington Post and, much to my dismay, even NBC News, in their reliance on tabloid reporting.

Photographers today get right up in your face, my wife’s, my baby’s. They are baiting you. You can tell they want to get into it with you. Some bump into me or block the entrance to my apartment, frustrating my neighbors (some of whom may regret that I live in their building).

I’m self-aware enough to know that I am to blame for some of this. I definitely should not have reacted the way I did in some of these situations. I don’t have these issues with waiters, traffic cops, store clerks. I know there’s an impression that I’m someone who seeks to have violent confrontations with people. I don’t. Do I regret screaming at some guy who practically clipped my kid in the head with the lens of a camera? Yeah, I probably do, because it’s only caused me problems.

But—I’m sorry, I can’t let go of this—do people really, really believe that, when I shouted at that guy, I called him a “faggot” on-camera? Do you honestly believe I would give someone like TMZ’s Harvey Levin, of all people, another club to beat me with?

What happened is, a TMZ videographer ambushed me as I was putting my family in a car, and I chased him down the block and said, “Cocksucking motherfucker” or whatever (when I have some volatile interaction with these people, I don’t pull out a pen and take notes on what I said). I knew that guy. This was a guy who is on a bike usually, and when we get in a car, he follows us. Very aggressive. The same guy who followed my wife on a bicycle, and when she slipped and fell trying to dodge him and hurt her leg, he laughed at her and said, “See what I made you do?” At my wife. How would that make you feel?

Last year began with making plans to do a play called Orphans, on Broadway. I was filled with hope. I had spent six and a half years on a television sitcom. I won every award you could win in television. I got paid well. And people loved 30 Rock. And I loved 30 Rock. I mean, sometimes you do a show that’s a hit show and you hate it. As my agent used to say, you don’t want to be walking down an alleyway with a flashlight in your hand for ten years, doing some police procedural. We had a ball. And everybody was funny. And I’ll never laugh that way again. And I miss that show terribly. I know we all had to move on because it’s Tina Fey’s show and Tina had worked herself to death. She’s a mom with two kids. Eventually, it had to end. But I’ll never have it that good again, professionally.

Getting back onstage seemed like a good idea. I loved Lyle Kessler’s play and was anxious to work with director Dan Sullivan. Then Shia LaBeouf showed up. I’d heard from other people that he was potentially very difficult to work with, but I always ignore that because people say the same thing about me. When he showed up, he seemed like a lot of young actors today—scattered, as he was coming from making six movies in a row or whatever.

There was friction between us from the beginning. LaBeouf seems to carry with him, to put it mildly, a jailhouse mentality wherever he goes. When he came to rehearsal, he was told it was important to memorize his lines. He took that to heart and learned all his lines in advance, even emailing me videos in which he read aloud his lines from the entire play. To prove he had put in the time. (What else do you do in jail?) I, however, do not learn my lines in advance. So he began to sulk because he felt we were slowing him down. You could tell right away he loves to argue. And one day he attacked me in front of everyone. He said, “You’re slowing me down, and you don’t know your lines. And if you don’t say your lines, I’m just going to keep saying my lines.”

We all sat, frozen. I snorted a bit, and, turning to him in front of the whole cast, I asked, “If I don’t say my words fast enough, you’re going to just say your next line?” I said. “You realize the lines are written in a certain order?” He just glared at me.

So I asked the company to break. And I took the stage manager, with Sullivan, to another room, and I said one of us is going to go. I said, “I’ll tell you what, I’ll go.” I said don’t fire the kid, I’ll quit. They said no, no, no, no, and they fired him. And I think he was shocked. He had that card, that card you get when you make films that make a lot of money that gives you a certain kind of entitlement. I think he was surprised that it didn’t work in the theater.

But firing LaBeouf didn’t help things. Sullivan played both sides. In emails, he coddled Shia. To me, he spoke differently. I was working with an older, more enervated Sullivan, who didn’t have the energy for any of this. I don’t think Sullivan liked the play—I don’t think he liked me. Sullivan agreed to do something that, once he realized what it was, he had lost interest in it. We closed early. I’ll forever be indebted to Ben Foster for stepping in for Shia. He is one of the good guys.

My “career” as a talk-show host started with a perfectly simple ambition. In my WNYC podcast, “Here’s the Thing,” I wanted to conduct interviews based on appreciation of my guests and their work. Or, in the case of those like George Will, a respect for their careers, whether I agreed with them or not. To think that something as uncomplicated and innocent as that led to the MSNBC debacle is still surreal to me. My goal was always to take a talk show to the network. I never wanted to be on MSNBC. My contacts at the network said to me, “We don’t have a slot for you on the network right now.” And I told them that was fine. And they said, “Maybe you go on MSNBC for a year and we’ll hone and refine the show?” And I said okay.

I watched MSNBC, prior to working there, very sporadically. Once I had signed a contract with them, I wanted to see more of what they were about. It turned out to be the same shit all day long. The only difference was who was actually pulling off whatever act they had come up with. Morning Joe was boring. Scarborough is neither eloquent nor funny. And merely cranky doesn’t always work well in the morning. Mika B. is the Margaret Dumont of cable news. I liked Chris Jansing a lot. Very straightforward. I like Lawrence O’Donnell, but he’s too smart to be doing that show. Rachel Maddow is Rachel Maddow, the ultimate wonk/dweeb who got a show, polished it, made it her own. She’s talented. The problem with everybody on MSNBC is none of them are funny, although that doesn’t prevent them from trying to be.

My pitch to them was: I’m going to bring the WNYC podcast to MSNBC. And that show is going to be eclectic—guests who don’t often get the microphone. I want to keep it simple. I get somebody in a chair and I shoot the shit with them for an hour and a half and we cut it into a one-hour show. Dick Cavett was my hero who allowed there to be pauses in the show. He put ­people on who were somewhat unconventional.

So I’m going to go on MSNBC, and people are speculating, “Oh, here he comes! Crazy liberal! And what’s he going to do? Is he going to try to give Bill Maher a run for his money? Is he going to try to give Jon Stewart a run for his money?” And I think, Are you out of your fucking mind? Those men are stars of established, highly successful shows. That’s never going to happen. My show was meant to be as harmless and inoffensive as could be. There was one theme to the 52 episodes of the WNYC podcast and only one way it worked—the show was about appreciation. I wasn’t out to get anybody or make anybody look bad, because I know what that’s like.

MSNBC assigned a producer to me, Jonathan Larsen. Like Sullivan with Orphans, Larsen didn’t get me or the show and didn’t want to be there. When I told him I wanted to interview Debra Winger, Larsen looked like, We’re here on a set, with an expensive crew and studio time, and you want to talk to Debra Winger? There was nothing less interesting to him. Most of the guests I suggested—Ellen Barkin, Neal Barnard from PCRM, JFK-conspiracy icon Mark Lane—he couldn’t care less. As we went along, Larsen would simply stare at me after everything I’d suggest and say, “Well, let’s see what Phil says.” Larsen was sent there to babysit me.

Phil Griffin is the head of MSNBC, and when I saw that Griffin didn’t have a single piece of paper on his desk, meeting after meeting after meeting, that should have been my first indication there was going to be a problem. Phil is a veteran programmer who knows well the corridors and chambers of television programming—and couldn’t give a flying fuck about content. All he wanted to talk about was Giants tickets, Super Bowl tickets, restaurants, movies. The conversations about the set, about the physical production of the show, cameras, lighting—it seemed like he wanted to get those over with as quickly as possible. He didn’t care. He had four monitors on the wall. They were all on, muted. He never listened to them. He never watched them.

The meetings with Phil were brisk and convivial. Eventually, however, we got to the point where he asked, “So you really meant it when you said you wanted to do your podcast on the air, on TV?” And I told him, yes, that was my idea. That was when he explained to me that TV, with its visual component, was different. When viewers turn the channel, they want to see something. They want to see Robert Redford. They want to see Justin Timberlake. TV “captures” the audience with the visual.

He said that we needed to change it up. At first I thought, This is not working. It was a mistake and I need to get out of here. And I told Phil so. Then I stopped and I said to myself, They might be right. I would try it their way.

The first name they came up with was Rob Lowe. They said, Rob Lowe’s going to be in the building. Do you want to interview Rob? I said, “Not particularly.” Rob’s a famous star of films, TV. He’s Rob Lowe. He’s famous. But there’s no shortage of outlets for him. And they looked at me like, You really don’t get it. I think they thought, You should have just said yes, simply to play the game.

I should have simply said, “Sure, bring in Rob Lowe.”

Just prior to all of this, there was Jimmy Gandolfini’s funeral. I was despondent about his death. Jimmy was a “showbiz friend,” one with whom I had worked and greeted warmly whenever our paths crossed. His death hit me somewhat hard, considering his baby daughter and the fact that he was younger than me. I ended up attacking a reporter who wrote in the Daily Mail online that my wife was tweeting from Jimmy’s funeral. He was wrong—in fact, at a later time, she had retweeted items whose original time code matched the time of the funeral.

In my rage, however, I called him a “toxic little queen,” and, thus, Anderson Cooper, the self-appointed Jack Valenti of gay media culture, suggested I should be “vilified,” in his words. I didn’t feel bad about the incident. He lied about my wife. They say this is what comes with stardom—I don’t agree with you. A journalist isn’t supposed to write a lie about you. If he was in New York, I might have had the impulse to beat the shit out of the guy. At the time, I didn’t view “toxic little queen” as a homophobic statement. I didn’t realize how those words could give offense, and I’m sorry for that.

Then this other thing happens with TMZ and then it becomes a one-two punch. All this is based on the fact of them believing what I said on a video.

Harvey Levin exists in his own universe. He’s this kind of cretinous barnacle on the press. Levin told the world that that muffled sound on the video—Levin wanted everyone to know he knows what it is. You don’t know, and I don’t know, but Levin knows, and he tells the world that it’s “faggot.”

I get angry, and I’ve said all sorts of things in anger, but I’d never use that word. Levin has so little regard for the truth, which is odd, knowing he was once a legal correspondent for the CBS affiliate in L.A. He’s also the one who revealed the tape that my ex-wife’s lawyers provided of me yelling at my daughter seven years ago. Knowing that none of it would have transpired if I hadn’t left the message in the first place, I think he hurt my daughter more than anyone.

In the recent video, you see me completely riled up and going after this guy and you hear me saying “cocksucker” and then some bisyllabic word that sounds like “faggot”—but wasn’t. Still, it doesn’t matter. glaad comes after me and Anderson Cooper comes after me and Andrew Sullivan comes after me, all maintaining that I’m a hateful homophobe. All based on what Harvey Levin told them.

Immediately prior to this, I’d go see Phil and I’d say, “What are the ratings?” If I had 15 meetings with Phil Griffin, 5 of them were after the show, with me saying, “What do you make of these ratings?” He’d say, “Don’t worry. It takes time.” (We beat Cooper two of three Fridays at ten.) Although he appeared to have some buyer’s remorse, he told me to hang in there. After the TMZ event, he said, “Don’t worry. I have to suspend you. But this will blow over.” I have all the emails to prove it. And then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, MSNBC said, “You’re fired.”

Once they fired me, a former MSNBC employee I knew emailed me. He said, “You watch now, Phil is going to start leaking left and right to bury you.” When I left, “Page Six” was flooded with lies about me. Another told me, regarding the “toxic little queen” comment, that Rachel Maddow was the prime mover in my firing, as she was aghast that I had been hired and viewed me as equivalent to Mel Gibson. Another source told me, “You know who’s going to get you fired, don’t you? Rachel. Phil will do whatever Rachel tells him to do.” I think Rachel Maddow is quite good at what she does. I also think she’s a phony who doesn’t have the same passion for the truth off-camera that she seems to have on the air.

They invoked a morals clause and refused to pay my contract. Later, when Martin Bashir resigned, I was disappointed. Bashir brought a depth of experience and polish that I imagined might help get MSNBC to a higher place, content-wise, in spite of Griffin and his episodes of Lockup and To Catch a Predator. I suppose the end of the show was inevitable. And the Conan O’Brien treatment came as no surprise. What hurt was that several of the writers and segment producers I worked with were wonderful and talented people. As I meandered through the ill-conceived process, I had grown very fond of them and hopeful about our possibilities once Larsen was replaced.

I went to the opening of the play Machinal, put on by Roundabout, where I’m on the board, and I can’t tell you how frosty the reception was toward me. These are all people who are heavy-hitting theatrical artists in that community and many of them are gay. And I was thinking to myself, These people think I’m a homophobe. And that makes me incredibly sad.
Every time people throw this mud on me, there are very serious consequences in my life. The single most painful episode for me was last year when a New York Post photographer, an ex-cop, accused me of ­calling him a “coon.” This was totally false, as was revealed on his own tape. A D.A. in the hate-crimes unit called me in. At the time, I had just been asked to join the board of the Arthur Ashe Learning Center, so I had to call Jeanne Moutoussamy­-Ashe and ask her, now that I was on the cover of the New York Post labeled as a racist, if she still wanted me to attend a coming event. Jeanne was her ever-gracious self and said yes, but that broke my heart.

I spent 25 years working hard for the issues I care about. When 30 Rock went into syndication, I sensed that I was going to be on TV for a bit, so I crafted my arrangement with Capital One Bank to fund my foundation for charitable giving. They paid me $15 million over nearly five years. After taxes and accounting fees, I will have given all of it, $14.125 million, to charity. After the TMZ event, Capital One did not renew my contract, although it politely said the two things were unrelated. AT&T had booked me for a paid speech in Orlando—and then canceled. WNYC lost funding for my radio show. Bill de Blasio, who apparently gets his news from TMZ, too, distanced himself from me.

Now I loathe and despise the media in a way I did not think possible. I used to engage with the media knowing that some of it would be adversarial, but now it’s superfluous at best and toxic at its worst. If MSNBC went off the air tomorrow, what difference would it make? If the Huffington Post went out of business tomorrow, what difference would it make? Arianna Huffington accomplished what she wanted to accomplish. She created this wonderful thing. And what have they done with that? They want clicks, I get it. They’ve gotta have clicks for their advertisers, so they’re going to need as much Kim Kardashian and wardrobe malfunctions as possible. The other day, they had a thing on the home page about pimples. Tripe. Liberal and conservative media are now precisely equivalent.

I’m aware that it’s ironic that I’m making this case in the media—but this is the last time I’m going to talk about my personal life in an American publication ever again.

When this whole thing happened, Warren Beatty, who is mystifyingly intelligent and wise, said to me: Your problem is a very basic one, and it’s very common to actors. And that’s when we step in front of a camera, we feel the need to make it into a moment. This instinct, even unconsciously, is to make the exchange in front of the camera a dramatic one. Perhaps I fell for that.
In the New Media culture, anything good you do is tossed in a pit, and you are measured by who you are on your worst day. What’s the Boy Scout code? Trustworthy. Loyal. Helpful. Friendly. Courteous. Kind. Obedient. Cheerful. Thrifty. Brave. Clean. Reverent. I might be all of those things, at certain moments. But people suspect that whatever good you do, you are faking. You’re that guy. You’re that guy that says this. There is a core of outlets that are pushing these stories out. Breitbart clutters the blogosphere with “Alec Baldwin, he’s the Devil, he’s Fidel Baldwin.”

Broadway has changed, by my lights. The TV networks, too. New York has changed. Even the U.S., which is so preposterously judgmental now. The heart, the arteries of the country are now clogged with hate. The fuel of American political life is hatred. Who would ever dream that Obama would deserve to be treated the way he has been? The birth-certificate bullshit, which is just Obama’s version of Swiftboating. And all for the electoral nullification that seems like a cancer on the American system. But this is Roger Ailes. And Fox. And Breitbart. And this is all about hate. It’s Hate Incorporated. But the liberals have taken the bait and run in the same direction—and it’s just as corrosive. MSNBC, in its own way, is as full of shit, as redundant and as superfluous, as Fox.

I think America’s more fucked up now than it’s ever been. People are angry that in the game of musical chairs that is the U.S. economy, there are less seats at the table when the music stops. And at every recession, the music is stopping.

Am I bitter about some of the things that have happened to me in the past year? Yes, I’m a human being. I always had big ambitions. I had dreams of running for office at some point in the next five years. In the pyramid of decision-making in New York City politics, rich people come first, unions second, and rank-and-file New Yorkers come dead last. I wanted to change that. I wanted to find a way to lower the cost of the city government and thus reduce New York’s shameful tax burden. I would have decentralized the schools. My father was a public-school teacher. He always told me that although you could encourage a child to work hard, you could only go so far; that half the goal had to be achieved at home. As progressive as I’ve been in my politics, there are other things I don’t think of as liberal or progressive, just common sense. Of course, another thing I would have done—and this will not surprise anyone—is change the paparazzi law.

I’ve lived in New York since 1979. It was a place that they gave you your anonymity. And not just if you were famous. New Yorkers nodded at you. New Yorkers smiled at you at the Shakespeare & Co. bookshop. New Yorkers would make a terse comment to you. “Big fan,” they’d say. “Loved you in Streetcar,” they’d say. They signaled their appreciation of you very politely. To be a New Yorker meant you gave everybody five feet. You gave everybody their privacy. I recall how, in a big city, many people had to play out private moments in public: a woman sobbing at a pay phone (remember pay phones?), someone studying their paperwork, undisturbed, at the Oyster Bar, before catching the train. We allowed people privacy, we left them alone. And now we don’t leave each other alone. Now we live in a digital arena, like some Roman Colosseum, with our thumbs up or thumbs down.

My uncle was a lifelong New Yorker. He said, “New York is the place where if you really are one in a million, there’s seven other people just like you right here in town!” And I used to laugh at that. He’d say, “New York, millionaires and whores shoulder to shoulder on 57th Street. Some of them millionaires and whores!”

There was a time the entire world didn’t have a camera in their pocket—the first thing that cell phones did was to kill the autograph business. Nobody cares about your autograph. There are cameras everywhere, and there are media outlets for them to “file their story.” They take your picture in line for coffee. They’re trying to get a picture of your baby. Everyone’s got a camera. When they’re done, they tweet it. It’s … unnatural.

I did not have a happy family life a few years ago. I was divorced and I was very alienated from my daughter and I was out there cutting every ribbon and running around New York hosting events for different causes to supplant my loss, because I didn’t have a family to go home to. Now I don’t want to be Mr. Show Business anymore. I want the same thing everybody else wants. I want a happy home, and for the first time in my adult life, I have one. I love my wife more than anything in the world and I love my child more than anything else in the world and I don’t want that to change in any way.

I probably have to move out of New York. I just can’t live in New York anymore. Everything I hated about L.A. I’m beginning to crave. L.A. is a place where you live behind a gate, you get in a car, your interaction with the public is minimal. I used to hate that. But New York has changed. Manhattan is like Beverly Hills. And the soul of New York has moved to Brooklyn, where everything new and exciting seems to be. I have to accept that. I want my newest child to have as normal and decent a life as I can provide. New York doesn’t seem the place for that anymore.

It’s good-bye to public life in the way that you try to communicate with an audience playfully like we’re friends, beyond the work you are actually paid for. Letterman. Saturday Night Live. That kind of thing. I want to go make a movie and be very present for that and give it everything I have, and after we’re done, then the rest of the time is mine. I started out as an actor, where you seek to understand yourself using the words of great writers and collaborating with other creative people. Then I slid into show business, where you seek only an audience’s approval, whether you deserve it or not. I think I want to go back to being an actor now.

There’s a way I could have done things differently. I know that. If I offended anyone along the way, I do apologize. But the solution for me now is: I’ve lived this for 30 years, I’m done with it.

And, admittedly, this is how I feel in February of 2014.

Shia LaBeouf went to a film screening recently and he wore a bag over his head and the bag says I AM NOT FAMOUS ­ANYMORE. And there was truly a part of me that felt sorry for him, oddly enough.",224000,11,0.716,0.514,0.414,0,0.216,-7.367,0.0293,109.9,0.236

Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand

I can't sleep, gotta leave
The summer sun is starting to peak
Through my window, lettin' me know
Time's up, it's time that we go
Got a lead foot waiting
And a pocket full of cash
Cooler full of beer
And a little something stashed
In the back of the car, so relax
There ain't a beach too far

Rolling with the top down

Little bikinis in white sand
In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan

Buncha kick back and chill
Out ahead of me
Gettin' wild, raisin' hell
And leavin' this town

Got that Daiquiri kiss

Makes you wanna get goin' there

Braucht keine Meinungen
Von 'nem Schaltier oder Schaf

Nein, nicht heute

Ich durchschaue deine Nummer
Denn du bist ein Witzbold
Und ich eine Killer-Queen auf dem Feld
Und du wirst den Ring küssen

Denn ich gewinne weiterhin

Und Karma ist keine Lügnerin
Sie behält die Quittung

Aber meine Truppe bringen sie zum Tanzen, wie Dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, meine Hater sind besessen
Denn ich verdiene M's, sie viel weniger
Versuch' nicht zurückzurudern
Ich verachte dich bereits
Diese ganze falsche Liebe, die du zeigst
Könnte dich nicht einmal tarnen
Gerannt? Wann? Nicki ist braun-gebrannt

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid

Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise

Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dark like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved

Drip too hard, caution on the floor

And then I let that ass up off the ground

Call me over the sooner I come, the sooner you cum
I’ll turn you out with the things I'm able to do
So come and get the best from me now

[Verse 1: Pardison Fontaine]
Let's get it straight, girl, you don't need a nigga for nothin'
Lookin' better every day, you got that Benjamin Button
Claimin' he don't got a girl, you know niggas be frontin'
You don't need no bitch comin' up to you as a woman (Ayy)
And you a boss, so you hate when niggas waste time (Ayy)
You too pretty to be paused on the FaceTime (Ayy)
Damn, I'm just statin' the facts
You hate that like you hate when niggas tell you, ""Relax""
What the fuck you mean, ""Relax""?
You want somethin' more than just physical (Word)
It's been a while since you met someone original (Word)
You spend your time drinkin' wine in your livin' room
All that good pussy, can't find the one to give it to (What?)
Issa, issa shame (issa shame)
You see me, see the squad, issa gang (Issa gang)
You see him, issa bum, issa lame (Issa lame)
But issa difference 'tween me and what's-his-name (Ayy)
I swear to God, word to Mase (Ayy)
I'ma drink this Henny to the face (Ayy)
Fuck a condom, I'ma bring Saran Wrap
I can't let no good pussy go to waste (Ayy)

[Chorus: Pardison Fontaine & Cardi B]
Back, back-backin' it up
I'm the king of talkin' shit, then backin' it up (Ayy)
Back, back-backin' it up
Throw that shit over here, girl, that's what it's for (What you say?)
You know how to go and get a bag, don't you? (Ayy)
You know how to make a bitch mad, don't you (Ayy)
Make your ex wanna get it back, that's a fact
Say it louder for the bitches in the back (Ayy)
I know how to go and get a bag, don't I (Don't I)
I know how to get a bitch mad, don't I (Yeah)
Make my ex wanna get it back, that's a fact

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, said I was gettin' some head, get-gettin' some head
Ran down on a bitch, she almost pissed on her leg
Bitches think they fuckin' with me, must be sick in the head
Why don't you chill with the beef and get some chicken instead?
Got the crown, shut it down, have them hype up in the 6
If she dead, let her lay won't bring no life into this bitch
Lookin' this good should be a sin, you should call me cinnamon
Cardi B, bad bitch, those is fuckin' synonyms
We see who winnin' (See who winnin'), we see who got it (See who got it)
You see I'm still in the bank makin' deposits (Cash)
You see who switched up sides and who was solid (Who was solid)
You see who stuck to the code and who forgot it
Talk about it, bitch

Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA

Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (soldier’s DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gon’ plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life

This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the maker of marriages

[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

[Verso 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Refrão: Beyoncé e Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain’t no Jesus
(It’s the curse of the— it’s the curse of the—)
I walk on water (shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verso 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Refrão: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verso 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's — a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
Pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Refrão: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Pós-Refrão: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you

Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second

[Verse 1]
As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

[Chorus]
Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

[Chorus]
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

[Bridge]
So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

[Chorus]
Hello my only one,  just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Running from an opp, and I shoot at opp (What)
And I'm on the block (What, what, what)
And I'm on the block (What)
In New York I Milly Rock (Hello?) hide it in my sock (What)
Hide it in my sock (What) selling that re-rock (What, what, what, what, what)

[Chorus]
In New York, I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Used to sell re-rock, running from the cops
Shooting at the opps (Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Shooting at the opps, 'cause I run they block
Gimme top (Top), in my drop-top
All these hoes gon' flock (Flock, flock), when I drop (Drop, drop)
All these hoes gon' flock (Flock, flock), when I drop (Drop, drop)
All these hoes gon' flock (Flock, flock), when I drop (Drop, drop)

[Verse]
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo
All these hoes want cash, all these hoes want bags
Fucking on yo' bitch, uh, I'm her dad
All these niggas sound like cash, sound like cash
I'm a soldier, damn, I thought I told you
Shootin' like a soldier, like I'm from Magnolia
All these, niggas, always, fold
Big, bank, never, fold
Sippin, Act', fill that shit slowly
Bitches, on me, say she like my clothing
I'm in London, Young Carti global
Designer is on me, call it dirty laundry
All these bitches want Young Carti, Young Carti (Yeah)
Ayy, Young Carti, Young Carti (What)
Young Carti, Young Carti (Yeah)

All of your bitches, they loose
All of my bitches, they rich
And they stay rockin' that Rick
What, what, huh, what, what, huh
Rich, rich, Cash Carti, bitch
Rich, bitch, got a rich clique
I'm suckin' on the clit, she suckin' on the dick
Give that hoe a tip, told her, ""Buy some kicks""
Then I brush my teeth, pop up in a whip
Glocky in the whip, glocky in the whip
And I'm cocky, fuckin' on a thotty
She just wanna plot me, bitch can't stop me
I'm riding in a Masi', this ain't even my Masi'
Oh, that's not yo' thottie? Yo' bitch look like a aunty
Walked in with Ashanti, damn, that look like 'Shanti
Damn, that look like Carti, I think that be Young Carti
Heard he spent a hunnid on a fucking watch piece, that's filthy

[Chorus]
In New York, I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Running from an opp, then I shoot at opp
And I'm on the block
And I'm on the block
In New York, I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Hide in my sock, selling that re-rock
What, what, what, what, what
In New York, I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Use to sell re-rock, running from the cops
Shooting at the opps

Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time, or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna' cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna' stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
So cold, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

Come fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, ""Cover your eyes
Cause fuckin' with me, you go blind""
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

[Pre-Chorus]
I put A$AP on my tat
I put New York on the map
I put the gang on the flames
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains
I got Goyard by the sack
I got the boof by the pack
I fucked your boo on her back

Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain

Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon
Formed against, yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings
The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
Truant livin' livin' in us, resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up

From dark roads he rose, to become a hero
Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people
Enemy is lethal, a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
Welcome to the story we call victory

Throw me off, I be, ""Off ya head""

Fuck your moral, fuck your family, fuck your tribe
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives

Still, duckin' shit that I did, boy
Niggas in Paris 'fore Hit-Boy
These ain't the same type of hits, boy
Shit can get litter than lit, boy
You don't take these type of risks, boy
'Cause this boy been throwin' that D like Rich Boy
You missed, boy; ya numbers don't add up on the blow
That was ten years ago – if you know, you know (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
This thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours
A fraternity of drug dealers ringin' off
I just happen to be alumni
Too legit, they still lookin' at me with one eye
The company I keep is not corporate enough
Child Rebel Soldier, you ain't orphan enough
A rapper turned trapper can't morph into us
But a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff
Dance contest for the smokers
I predict snow, Al Roker
(If you know, you know)
I only ever looked up to Sosa
You all get a bird, this nigga Oprah

[Chorus]
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball court
(If you know, you know)
One stop like a Walmart
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door's supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason we ball for
Circle round twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)

[Verse 3]
You ever been hit with the water weight
Then had to weigh, ""Do you war or wait?""
(If you know, you know)
When we all clickin' like Golden State
And you and your team are the motorcade
(If you know, you know)
Been grantin' wishes like a genie
Two bad hoes in two-piece bikinis
I've been hidin' where you can see me
The skybox is right next to RiRi's
Solely responsible for showin' rappers how to stand
On the front lines when trappers started throwin' bands
Where were you when Big Meech brought the tigers in?
'Cause I was busy earnin' stripes like a tiger's skin

[Chorus]
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball court
(If you know, you know)

Mi corazón está roto, pero sigo

Must've never fell as hard as I did 'cause then they wouldn't say

Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down

So baby let me look at you and see just what I got
If you were my cherry stem I'd tie you in a knot
And if I could inhale you, oh baby I'd be gone
I'd be floating round high as the Colorado sky blowing smoke rings all night long

Never leaned back on a jet black Chevy, blowing smoke rings in the dark

Yeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change

Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up
Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove
But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you

Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it

And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?

They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this

My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions

Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help

What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and he's great?
Oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
Just add water, stir it like a shake

No jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder

This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

[Verse 3]
Ain't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'
With Ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options
Caviar facials remove the toxins
This ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters
Who grew up on legends from outer Yonkers
Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya
Who said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers
The only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
Chess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin
Stay woke, nigga, or get out
Still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out
Might buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out
The message in this music, all my niggas had to live out

She said she wanna stay together
I don't think I can, ooh

[Verse 1]
Red light, you know I can't make this thing that official
Believe we had a great night but I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you, shit
You don't like that I make this easy, leaving after sexing on the floor
Baby, I know you need me like I need you, but I'm not the one you wanna love

[Hook]
So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like
You used to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and girl, it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party 'til we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love
Don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love

[Verse 2]
Shawty if you looking for somebody trying to settle down
Probably won't be around, nah baby
You should hit me when you tired
Of playing up in the house and ain't nobody around, you need that
When you need that late night
We can both make love to the daylight, you got it girl, you got it girl
But you know I can't stay right? Uh, nah babe
All I want is you so what you tryna do?

No love, no love, no love, no love, no love
No love, no love, no love, no love, no love
Until the morning we can freak, but baby girl, you gotta know
We can rumble in these sheets but after this you gotta go
Don't take it personal, when it feel so good, we tend to get emotional
But that is when you find out that it hurts the most, since then I've always been like, trust nobody show no love

Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout ""we"" a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
All she talkin' bout is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
All she ever say is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no
Yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't
Yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Drake]
Swear these days all you say is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
All she hit me with is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""

[Verse 3: Drake]
Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
All she talkin' bout is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""

I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey
And does he want you to be just a little more city?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up

[Verse 2]
He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in (Walked in)
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you

Beta tu hagta tu raato ko jaagta hu sakta hu, kya bola samja tu, karta mai mann ka hu..

Kaatil hu karta mai crime..

Pasand aata ganna, hindi me bharte deta rhyme

Aayga mera bhi time, aisa ki khayega market ko tera bhi bhai

Nahi hona famous, ye sab kuch hai game ab hai, fake, abe khel sab hai paise ka bhai..

Pairo ko mere ab chumo..
Pichwada ghuma k jhuku
Baato pe meri ab jhumo..
Jo bhi maine bola bhulo..

Jo bhi mai bolu q aise suune lage jaise ki mai hi hu hero..
Tinna na netti nen cinna nu unnawa emantuna nuvu innu..

Da da Dard hai dill me fir bhi rehta hu chill me karu baato se kill mai challo side do
Muje khana hai muje bhi ek bite do
Kabhi aake gaano se mere bhi tum ride lo

Tu to barf hai chal be bane mard tu jhand hai kare dard tu sarme chal bye bol..
Mere lafz hi farz hai, mera dhanda
Sare bole studio me hi band behta psyco..

Are mera bhai meri zindagi, meri marzi hai meri soch

Я хочу рассказать тебе историю
Ты знаешь, я дорожу тобой
Надеюсь, в ней не слишком много чувств

[Припев: Lil Wayne]
Я вижу ниггеров в этой сучке, опустошающих бутылку за бутылкой
Напиваются с этими сучками
И когда они уходят, за ними следуют
Засыпают с этой сучкой, ничего о ней не зная
Затем она впускает нас, мы забираем все твоё дерьмо
И когда ты просыпаешься, она помогает тебе попытаться найти это, я люблю это

[Куплет 1: Lil Wayne]
Я зависаю с сучками, которые зависают с сучками
Которые зависают с богатыми ниггерами
Я говорю ей: «возьми их», она говорит: «У меня уже есть ты»
Я говорю: «Нет, сучка, возьми его»
И они такие милые, и у них длинные волосы
Он напился и спит на её сиськах
Затем она подаёт нам сигнал, мы входим с АК
""Это ограбление!"" Она кричит, словно жертва
Теперь ты чувствуешь себя так глупо
Я курю траву, мне так кайфово, словно я Ceelie
Ссыкун дрожит, что ты там сказал?
Следи за языком, Милли Ванилли
Ты можешь быть подставлен, ты можешь быть обманут
Сучкой, к которой у тебя есть чувства
Потому что ты думал, что она ангел
Но эта сучка - не ангел, я использую её нимб вместо фрисби
И ты рассказываешь про свои дела - она передаёт это мне
Ты рассказываешь этой суке о своих чувствах
Она вливала тебе в уши сладкую ложь
Ложь текла даже сквозь её зубы
Она знает, где тебе спрятаться, чтобы рассказать мне, где ты спрятался
Она знает, когда тебе стоит уйти, чтобы рассказать мне, когда приходить
Мы врываемся в твой дом и забираем всё
Пока сучка на отдыхе с ним
Так что её не обвиняют, мы не цепляемся
Мы узнаем адреса и не оставляем беспорядка
Ты заметишь пропажу только когда начнёшь искать её
И подумаешь, что стоит ещё подумать
Она спросит тебя: ""Что-то не так?"", ты ответишь: ""Ничего, отдыхай""
Она спросит: ""Что пропало?"", ты ответишь: ""Откуда ты узнала, что что-то пропало?""
Он почешет голову, она скажет: ""Возвращайся в постель""
И сделает ему минет. Чувак, не доверяй сукам
И она сказала: ""Ооо...""

[Припев: Lil Wayne]
Я вижу ниггеров в этой сучке, опустошающих бутылку за бутылкой
Напиваются с этими сучками
И когда они уходят, за ними следуют
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin’
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don’t ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!""
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told ya""
She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin’ outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin’ so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain’t here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that’s enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (uh)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(… lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do?
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge her
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself

Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Moo, 'member when you had them green things mailed
With vacuum seals tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you everyday before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan though, ayy, Theo ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
Ayy, JR nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened?
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gone drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, ""Get ahead of them niggas!""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders
(Boom-Boom-Boom!)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch I came home to my lil brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on

I think it was last year on my birthday when you  broke the news
Things ain't rollin' how we need them to and we have to move
But I said, ""Dad, get those moving boxes out the room""
And cut the cake, I'll get it, I got it, I'll give my all for you
Too many memories and feelings I'm not down to pack
So lately I've been putting all this weight up on my back
I know that's never what you wanted dad, but understand
We can't afford another heart attack to keep the fam intact
It's whatever as long as we stick together
This shit's forever, above us there's nothin' better
Do you remember when you said ""Do what you love
And don't give up, it's in your blood""
That's when you taught me that
If all I have is me, then all I need is family
If all I have is home, then all I am is happy
I may not know it all but I know this
Home isn't where you are, it's who you're with and it...

Why fix something if it isn't broke?
You call it holding on, I call it hope
I'm not tryna make my sister move or tryna change my momma's mood
So I got all this shit to do to make sure movin's not the move
'Cause lately I've been feeling all this pressure within
But one day we gon' all be back together again

Sending all these dollars, dimes to you
When I'm out there on the road, you can always hit my phone
So I'm always right there next to you

Calculan que relaciones que fracasan
Mayormente es por desengaño
Falsedad que contamina y hace daño
Tú fuiste perfecto clavel que con mis manos marchité
Mi obra se llama ""Romeo sin Julieta otra vez""
Puedes pensar ""Soy el rey de las mentiras, volvería a fallar""
Aunque lo jure por mi vida
Mis palabras no importan ni valen ni de rodilla na' 'e na'
Dice que ha visto muchas novelas, el actor debe llorar

[Pre-Coro: Romeo Santos]
No, ¿ahora qué hago?
Ozuna y yo somos farsantes, nos ahogamo' en el fracaso
No, no juro en vano
Jamás yo vuelvo a ser infiel con chapiadoras, yo te amo
No, escúchame esa pena que siento
Voy a hacer otro disco con Aventura y te lo dedico enterito

804,804,804,At Last,Sundance Head,"A single knoll rises out of the plain in Oklahoma, north and west of the Wichita Range. For my people, the Kiowas, it is an old landmark, and they gave it the name Rainy Mountain. The hardest weather in the world is there. Winter brings blizzards, hot tornadic winds arise in the spring, and in summer the prairie is an anvil's edge. The grass turns brittle and brown, and it cracks beneath your feet. There are green belts along the rivers and creeks, linear groves of hickory and pecan, willow and witch hazel. At a distance in July or August the steaming foliage seems almost to writhe in fire. Great green and yellow grasshoppers are everywhere in the tall grass, popping up like corn to sting the flesh, and tortoises crawl about on the red earth, going nowhere in the plenty of time.

Loneliness is an aspect of the land. All things in the plain are isolate; there is no confusion of objects in the eye, but one hill or one tree or one man. To look upon that landscape in the early morning, with the sun at your back, is to lose the sense of proportion. Your imagination comes to life, and this, you think, is where Creation was begun.

I returned to Rainy Mountain in July. My grandmother had died in the spring, and I wanted to be at her grave. She had lived to be very old and at last infirm. Her only living daughter was with her when she died, and I was told that in death her face was that of a child.

I like to think of her as a child. When she was born, the Kiowas were living the last great moment of their history. For more than a hundred years they had controlled the open range from the Smoky Hill River to the Red, from the headwaters of the Canadian to the fork of the Arkansas and Cimarron. In alliance with the Comanches, they had ruled the whole of the southern Plains. War was their sacred business, and they were among the finest horsemen the world has ever known. But warfare for the Kiowas was preeminently a matter of disposition rather than of survival, and they never understood the grim, unrelenting advance of the U.S. Cavalry. When at last, divided and ill provisioned, they were driven onto the Staked Plains in the cold rains of autumn, they fell into panic. In Palo Duro Canyon they abandoned their crucial stores to pillage and had nothing then but their lives. In order to save themselves, they surrendered to the soldiers at Fort Sill and were imprisoned in the old stone corral that now stands as a military museum. My grandmother was spared the humiliation of those high gray walls by eight or ten years, but she must have known from birth the affliction of defeat, the dark brooding of old warriors.

Her name was Aho, and she belonged to the last culture to evolve in North America. Her forebears came down from the high country in western Montana nearly three centuries ago. They were a mountain people, a mysterious tribe of hunters whose language has never been positively classified in any major group. In the late seventeenth century they began a long migration to the south and east. It was a journey toward the dawn, and it led to a golden age. Along the way the Kiowas were befriended by the Crows, who gave them the culture and religion of the Plains. They acquired horses, and their ancient nomadic spirit was suddenly free of the ground. They acquired Tai-me, the sacred Sun Dance doll, from that moment the object and symbol of their worship, and so shared in the divinity of the sun. Not least, they acquired the sense of destiny, therefore courage and pride. When they entered upon the southern Plains they had been transformed. No longer were they slaves to the simple necessity of survival; they were a lordly and dangerous society of fighters and thieves, hunters and priests of the sun. According to their origin myth, they entered the world through a hollow log. From one point of view, their migration was the fruit of an old prophecy, for indeed they emerged from a sunless world.

Although my grandmother lived out her long life in the shadow of Rainy Mountain, the immense landscape of the continental interior lay like memory in her blood. She could tell of the Crows, whom she had never seen, and of the Black Hills, where she had never been. I wanted to see in reality what she had seen more perfectly in the mind's eye, and traveled fifteen hundred miles to begin my pilgrimage.

Yellowstone, it seemed to me, was the top of the world, a region of deep lakes and dark timber, canyons and waterfalls. But, beautiful as it is, one might have the sense of confinement there. The skyline in all directions is close at hand, the high wall of the woods and deep cleavages of shade. There is a perfect freedom in the mountains, but it belongs to the eagle and the elk, the badger and the bear. The Kiowas reckoned their stature by the distance they could see, and they were bent and blind in the wilderness.

Descending eastward, the highland meadows are a stairway to the plain. In July the inland slope of the Rockies is luxuriant with flax and buckwheat, stonecrop and larkspur. The earth unfolds and the limit of the land recedes. Clusters of trees, and animals grazing far in the distance, cause the vision to reach away and wonder to build upon the mind. The sun follows a longer course in the day, and the sky is immense beyond all comparison. The great billowing clouds that sail upon it are shadows that move upon the grain like water, dividing light. Farther down, in the land of the Crows and Blackfeet, the plain is yellow. Sweet clover takes hold of the hills and bends upon itself to cover and seal the soil. There the Kiowas paused on their way; they had come to the place where they must change their lives. The sun is at home on the plains. Precisely there does it have the certain character of a god. When the Kiowas came to the land of the Crows, they could see the darklees of the hills at dawn across the Bighorn River, the profusion of light on the grain shelves, the oldest deity ranging after the solstices. Not yet would they veer southward to the caldron of the land that lay below; they must wean their blood from the northern winter and hold the mountains a while longer in their view. They bore Tai-me in procession to the east.

A dark mist lay over the Black Hills, and the land was like iron. At the top of a ridge I caught sight of Devil's Tower upthrust against the gray sky as if in the birth of time the core of the earth had broken through its crust and the motion of the world was begun. There are things in nature that engender an awful quiet in the heart of man; Devil's Tower is one of them. Two centuries ago, because they could not do otherwise, the Kiowas made a legend at the base of the rock. My grandmother said: Eight children were there at play, seven sisters and their brother. Suddenly the boy was struck dumb; he trembled and began to run upon his hands and feet. His fingers became claws, and his body was covered with fur. Directly there was a bear where the boy had been. The sisters were terrified; they ran, and the bear after them. They came to the stump of a great tree, and the tree spoke to them. It bade them climb upon it, and as they did so it began to rise into the air. The bear came to kill them, but they were just beyond its reach. It reared against the tree and scored the bark all around with its claws. The seven sisters were borne into the sky, and they became the stars of the Big Dipper.

From that moment, and so long as the legend lives, the Kiowas have kinsmen in the night sky. Whatever they were in the mountains, they could be no more. However tenuous their well-being, however much they had suffered and would suffer again, they had found a way out of the wilderness.

My grandmother had a reverence for the sun, a holy regard that now is all but gone out of mankind. There was a wariness in her, and an ancient awe. She was a Christian in her later years, but she had come a long way about, and she never forgot her birthright. As a child she had been to the Sun Dances; she had taken part in those annual rites, and by them she had learned the restoration of her people in the presence of Tai-me. She was about seven when the last Kiowa Sun Dance was held in 1887 on the Washita River above Rainy Mountain Creek. The buffalo were gone. In order to consummate the ancient sacrifice--to impale the head of a buffalo bull upon the medicine tree--a delegation of old men journeyed into Texas, there to beg and barter for an animal from the Goodnight herd.

She was ten when the Kiowas came together for the last time as a living Sun Dance culture. They could find no buffalo; they had to hang an old hide from the sacred tree. Before the dance could begin, a company of soldiers rode out from Fort Sill under orders to disperse the tribe. Forbidden without cause the essential act of their faith, having seen the wild herds slaughtered and left to rot upon the ground, the Kiowas backed away forever from the medicine tree. That was July 20, 1890, at the great bend of the Washita. My grandmother was there. Without bitterness, and for as long as she lived, she bore a vision of deicide.

Now that I can have her only in memory, I see my grandmother in the several postures that were peculiar to her: standing at the wood stove on a winter morning and turning meat in a great iron skillet; sitting at the south window, bent above her beadwork, and afterwards, when her vision failed, looking down for a long time into the fold of her hands; going out upon a cane, very slowly as she did when the weight of age came upon her; praying. I remember her most often at prayer. She made long, rambling prayers out of suffering and hope, having seen many things. I was never sure that I had the right to hear, so exclusive were they of all mere custom and company. The last time I saw her she prayed standing by the side of her bed at night, naked to the waist, the light of a kerosene lamp moving upon her dark skin. Her long, black hair, always drawn and braided in the day, lay upon her shoulders and against her breasts like a shawl. I do not speak Kiowa, and I never understood her prayers, but there was something inherently sad in the sound, some merest hesitation upon the syllables of sorrow. She began in a high and descending pitch, exhausting her breath to silence; then again and again--and always the same intensity of effort, of something that is, and is not, like urgency in the human voice. Transported so in the dancing light among the shadows of her room, she seemed beyond the reach of time. But that was illusion; I think I knew then that I should not see her again.

Houses are like sentinels in the plain, old keepers of the weather watch. There, in a very little while, wood takes on the appearance of great age. All colors wear soon away in the wind and rain, and then the wood is burned gray and the grain appears and the nails turn red with rust. The windowpanes are black and opaque; you imagine there is nothing within, and indeed there are many ghosts, bones given up to the land. They stand here and there against the sky, and you approach them for a longer time than you expect. They belong in the distance; it is their domain.

Once there was a lot of sound in my grandmother's house, a lot of coming and going, feasting and talk. The summers there were full of excitement and reunion. The Kiowas are a summer people; they abide the cold and keep to themselves, but when the season turns and the land becomes warm and vital they cannot hold still; an old love of going returns upon them. The aged visitors who came to my grandmother's house when I was a child were made of lean and leather, and they bore themselves upright. They wore great black hats and bright ample shirts that shook in the wind. They rubbed fat upon their hair and wound their braids with strips of colored cloth. Some of them painted their faces and carried the scars of old and cherished enmities. They were an old council of warlords, come to remind and be reminded of who they were. Their wives and daughters served them well. The women might indulge themselves; gossip was at once the mark and compensation of their servitude. They made loud and elaborate talk among themselves, full of jest and gesture, fright and false alarm. They went abroad in fringed and flowered shawls, bright beadwork and German silver. They were at home in the kitchen, and they prepared meals that were banquets.

There were frequent prayer meetings, and great nocturnal feasts. When I was a child I played with my cousins outside, where the lamplight fell upon the ground and the singing of the old people rose up around us and carried away into the darkness. There were a lot of good things to eat, a lot of laughter and surprise. And afterwards, when the quiet returned, I lay down with my grandmother and could hear the frogs away by the river and feel the motion of the air.

Now there is a funeral silence in the rooms, the endless wake of some final word. The walls have closed in upon my grandmother's house. When I returned to it in mourning, I saw for the first time in my life how small it was. It was late at night, and there was a white moon, nearly full. I sat for a long time on the stone steps by the kitchen door. From there I could see out across the land; I could see the long row of trees by the creek, the low light upon the rolling plains, and the stars of the Big Dipper. Once I looked at the moon and caught sight of a strange thing. A cricket had perched upon the handrail, only a few inches away from me. My line of vision was such that the creature filled the moon like a fossil. It had gone there, I thought, to live and die, for there, of all places, was its small definition made whole and eternal. A warm wind rose up and purled like the longing within me.

The next morning I awoke at dawn and went out on the dirt road to Rainy Mountain. It was already hot, and the grasshoppers began to fill the air. Still, it was early in the morning, and the birds sang out of the shadows. The long yellow grass on the mountain shone in the bright light, and a scissortail hied above the land. There, where it ought to be, at the end of a long and legendary way, was my grandmother's grave. Here and there on the dark stones were ancestral names. Looking back once, I saw the mountain and came away.",207853,2,0.228,0.419,0.555,0,0.113,-5.531,0.0275,101.667,0.375

Cool with it, I get it though
First year we both fronted
We had feelings we didn't show
Second year we couldn't hide it
Funny part they didn't know
How could something that's so wrong feel so right?
But who to tell you this wrong, though? This your life
Word up

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
We just fucking up the city, going hard every night
Niggas hating on us, you know lord they ain't right
Cause I broke a lot of hearts, ain't do them girls right
But you broke hearts too, but that boy ain't fight
So they don't deserve it, it feel like it's perfect
I'm loving your style the way you preserve it
Just look at my eyes and see what's inside
You know that it's pride, you say that I'm worth it
But said I ain't ready, really I'm ready
Really I'm ready, I'm ready like never before
I'mma just give you a key to my heart
You'll be the first that I let in the door
I used to hear that you flirt with them guys
They never would score
All you was hearing about me and the women
Ain't trust them before
You know what you're doing, fuck what they said
You know what we on
When we in bed, it's like we on stage
And I got the mic so let me perform, sing it

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before

I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you
I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us, (woo)
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night, then, tell me, why you actin' cold to me?
You ain't the only one to blame, no, I'm the one that made you rich when I bought every lie you sold to me
Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures
But you still got the memories of us, so I guess I don't really make a difference
Flippin' through 'em in your head
Got you texting me all hours of the night
Yeah, you told me that you needed distance
What's the deal with you?
You say you want a man that keeps it real
Then why you mad when I get real with you?
You want someone to pay the bills for you
Went from feelin' you, now I feel for you, liar

[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?

But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

[Verse 2]
Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends?
Tellin' people that's how we been?
Tellin' everybody, yeah, that we was barely speakin'
Ah, that's kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then?
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool
Then don't hit me on the weekend, tellin' me you missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah
Why you playin' with my mind, huh?
Why you playin' with my time, huh?
Told me, ""We should let it go and put it all behind us""
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama
You told me that you don't really wanna talk—then why you callin', huh?

[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life

Takin' pictures of people we thought were stars
It’s easy to give in to your heart

Was the band that you had on your t-shirt
We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me, and we were …

Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes

[Verse 2: Kenny Chesney + Together]
Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier
Said ""Do you think we’ll live forever?"" As we killed another beer
And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were laughin' until we were breathless
Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless
And comin' alive and we were…

She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway

Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter

The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun

Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me ""No"" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one

You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

Sometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil Jack
One year, it's Illuminati; next year, it's the Sunken Place
They don't want me to change, nah, nigga run in place

Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse

These niggas know what up, know I'm 'bout whateva
I'm in the streets, I keep that heat, you know that I be steppin'

[Verse 1]
I miss the Nawf just like my granny, my heart in them trenches
Yo' girl gon' cheat on you for nothing, so I'm done with these bitches
I think about it every minute, ain't stoppin' my mission
On my payroll I got hittas, I pay 'em commision
Interrogated by detectives, won't tell 'em I did it
I told Montana that I love him, on Dave I meant it
Put twenty thousand on his head, they catch him, I send it
Get on my knee on side the bed like ""Father, forgive me""
Was sellin' weed, fucked up my profit, I ain't make a dolla
The fame gettin' to my niggas, I cut off my partners
Before I call on you, I put my trust up in this choppa
Movin' like he can't get touched real quick, I bet I stop 'em
Nigga ain't give me shit but hand out like I owe him something
I don't give a fuck, if we step together, I'll show you something
Bitches think they slick, they all deceive so I'll never love 'em
Bre was my first love but she changed so I'll never trust her

This the story of a child who was in them streets
Why the fuck I'm taking care of them? They ain't do shit for me
Why the fuck I'm showing you so much love?
And bitch you leaving me

I'm full of pain but wake up every morning and I'm smilin'
They think I'm dumb, you got me fucked up, I got plenty knowledge
They don't give a fuck 'bout how I feel, they don't know my problems
Just 'cause you around me, I ain't forget 'bout everything you said
I let some shots off in the air for my niggas dead
Do anything in the world for you, I'm livin' red
Showin' love to them niggas, they might bust my head
Mad 'bout a gun, but for a fact bitch I won't do you nothin'
Mad that I'm up but you remember, you ain't give me nothing
I ain't give up on my mission, fuck you mean bitch? I was steady hustlin'
Handin' all you niggas money bitch, and I was steady strugglin'
Montana know about my pain and everything I told him
I told him watch what he was saying, but shit I had to fold him
Up in that cell, bitch I was cryin' with no one to hold me
YoungBoy a soldier, I remember what my grampa told me

Batty bwoy if you cross, I'ma take your life
I'm full of drugs so I'ma die if I get caught tonight
Tell my lil' brother and my sons it's gon' be alright

He was abandoned as a child screamin', ""Red rum""
You spell it backwards, what that mean? Nigga, murder
Livin' wrong and right, trustin' nobody 'til his time come

Where I come from I gotta keep this bitch up on my hip
Momma forgive me for all them times I use to trip
Know it's a purpose in this world why I need to live

It ain't too long

Y'all tell me 'bout all y'all problems, y'all don't ask how I'm feelin' huh?

And all the people who miss they babies, you heard me?
Fuck everybody who ain't mine, y'all ain't making my life no betta, gang

Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably 'cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back, but
I'mma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent

Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress

Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic

""Thanks, Hannah, thanks for coming back""

[Verse 1]
The city’s so in style
All you see for miles are people spilling in and out of cars
Man, I love these bars are making a killin'
Everywhere I go looks like the place to be
I see people that I know and I feel like there’s no one here but me

[Chorus]
Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say ""hi""
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you’re still in my head
There ain’t no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown’s dead, downtown’s dead

[Verse 2]
They're dancing in the strobes
Out here in the throws of loud house music
Everything’s a blur
I don’t hear the words, but lips are moving
Try to get involved, but I’ve 'bout had enough of people wall to the wall
And I’m just holdin' it up 'cause...

[Bridge]
Free drinks, bright lights
What am I doing with my life?
Okay, I quit… I’ve had enough of this
'Cause people are losing their minds
Can’t get you out of my head
I’m calling it a night
I’m crawling back to your bed…

Remember being broke, wishin' on a star

Foreign car, push button, autostart
Rest and relaxation not involved, goin' hard Rolls Royce, R&R
Wonder why these niggas hate me?
Probably 'cause they know they ain't me
I ain't never been a gang member, Illinois labeled me a gang chief
Political spear, Judge Linehan racist, I’m bein' sentenced
Wrongful conviction, broke bread and lied to me
Gave him a quarter ticket, he did not appeal it
Layin' in my cell, lookin' at the ceiling
I'm on a division, me and all the killers
Throwin' shit and piss on all the staff members
Even got the warden, that’s why they had to ship us

Gettin' out with the key to success and these niggas gon' blame it on Khaled
They don't wanna see you win (They don't!)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (No!)
You don't wanna see your bitch caught up in the stars like she outer space

With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile

We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no

Talkin' 'bout takin' somethin' from me, like no way (Nah)
Thugga Thugger, that's my brother, brother (Thugger, Thugger)
You don't want no trouble trouble or you can get these fists, knuckle, knuckle (Hey)
Buckle up like a seatbelt or I'll shoot yah
Punchin' on the gas (Skrrt), too fast, and I lose yah (Hey)
Give me a bed, and I'll do her (Hey), I want her head, Medusa (Ooh)
I swear a nigga gone 'cause this strong I'm blowin' super (OG, nigga)
Ayy, grindin' for a new day (What you doin'?)
I'm skatin', like that nigga Lupe (Swear to God)
Hey, I'm on the top just like toupee (I'm on the top, nigga)
Ayy, I'm in her mouth just like toothpaste

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga livin' life like a beginner and this is only beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain, puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'

[Outro: Birdman]
Sitting in the middle of this ocean, Pacific that is
You understand me? Bunch of bad bitches, ya heard?
Popping that GTV, living that lifestyle, ya heard?
I do this for Ms. Gladys, boy - 100

1074,74,74,Cry Pretty,Carrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Verse 2]
Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Bridge]
Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, woo
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Y'all know, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go!
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm willin' to die for this shit
I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
D-O-T my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy
I been stomped out in front of my mama
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch, all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my Telegram like, ""Be cautious!""
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know

[Chorus]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

[Verse 2]
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go yeah, I go yeah
They never been ready, yeah, I know yeah, know yeah
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at they laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option

[Chorus]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy

Damned if I do, if I don't (Yuh)
Goddamn us all if you won't (Yuh)
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way

[Verse 3]
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference between black artists and wack artists

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy

[Intro: Jessica Gomes]
(May-May-May)
What is this? (May-May-May)
Maybach Music
I like this Maybach Music, hahahaha

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
She's just perfect in every kinda way
But I don't think I can handle her pain
So messed up and I'm too busy just runnin' my game
Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Rick Ross]
I've tried to change, but they always around pullin' me down in bed (May-May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises (boom)
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex (uh)
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right, I know

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We at the crib, she got her legs wrapped around my waist
Conversation, she lick every tattoo that's on my face
Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessin' my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies apologized, the thirst real
When she hear this thinkin' to herself, ""Damn this verse real""
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Sent the bottles to her table, then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the 'gram, they trendin' Meech home
In the D and my G, he throwin' that P-Stone
Every picture that you post, we comments on each one

[Verse 3: Chris Brown  & Rick Ross]
I'm just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I can't change the rules
All this time I blamed you 'cause I know what I'm doing
Stepping on your heart again, relationship ruined
I tried to change, but I'm always out, fuckin' around in the club (May-May)
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up (uh)
My worst nightmare went right in my back, I wish I could wake up (uh)
I feel like shit, know I ain't shit, but I'm... (May-May-May)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rick Ross]
Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right, I know (gotta love it, baby, uh) (May-May-May)

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Life's short and baby girl, you deserve a winner
Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart, so every night I can deliver (uh)
Sayin', ""Sorry"", layin' up, I'm way up in your liver (boss)
The red bottoms got you walkin' funny (ha)
Get you an agent, she ballin' and all she talk is money (right)
Take her shoppin', baby boy, ain't no salary caps (uh)
She get it poppin', so you better bring battery packs (huh)
Perfect time to relax
Nothing is perfect other than me and the perfect match
They all watch me 'cause the moves I make out they budgets
Diamond district, six figures on my shorty nugget

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I've tried to change, but they always around, pullin' me down in bed (May-May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex
Yeah, I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Sorry, won't turn back the clock (May-May)
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right (May-May-May)",330507,8,0.139,0.616,0.641,0,0.0958,-7.275,0.0938,82.73,0.68

When you come back in here, we gon' be like, ayy!
Trust me, bitch, trust me

Hypnotize me with that motion
Girl, you might even provoke me
To spend, spend all I've got
I can get it back real quick
Give you an experience
Like you've never had before
Dreamcatcher on your thigh, yeah
How'd you get so fine, babe?
I can make you go night, night
I can make you go night, night
You be down for whatever
When I pour it up, I don't measure (Hey)
Say you love me five-ever
All of a sudden
Make this bitch jump like a step team
See my diamonds, can you say, ""Wet dream""?
First, let me close the bamboo blinds
She don't say my name but she gonna scream it

[Refrain: Swae Lee]
Dancin' in the strobe lights
With your eyes on me
I don't need to know your sign
Do you see somethin' you like?

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Hey, yeah!
I can't take your call, I need FaceTime
Rode the metro, took the bassline
Took all the good stuff, now it ain't mine (Hey)
You've been gone for forever
How much I miss your love, I can't measure (No)
Know you got it, nothin' special
But just for this night, go up a level (Hey)
When we pop outside, let you take lead (Lead)
She just treat the dick like a jetski (Skeet, skeet)
Models posted up like a set piece (Piece)
Where you get these from? I can't take these (Down, yeah)
I'm the one, number one
I've done finally found my home between the moon and the sun
Every time we come around, just know it move and it run
Man it's crazy, all my youngins gotta move with a gun
Drop it down, drop it down, way you do it
Know you come from out of town
I've been stuck off in my ways, I've been workin' on it
On some on my own time, don't be waitin' on me
I've been zoned out in the days, it's a head burst
I've been livin' through a maze on my Fred Durst
Get that shit from out my way, make the mess worse
To the A.M., I make my rounds
Not a peep, don't hear a sound
Now you know if you ain't know it, now you know

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Travis Scott]
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
Into, I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
Into, I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into (Hey)

[Refrain: Swae Lee]
Dancin' in the strobe lights

I don't need to know your sign
Do you see somethin' you like?

Body hotter than a summer

Ain't got time right now
Missed me with that
""What's your name, your sign"" right now

She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime

All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

I've been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you, would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I, even need you? Should I leave you?
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you?
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
I gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is about...

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Life is about makin' mistakes
It's also about trying to be great
Do not let failure scare you away
I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us, I can speak about it 'cause I did it (true)
Ladies and gentlemen, here's the exhibit
It's my life, look a little closer, you can see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waitin' for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
Tell me could you love me? Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you...

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly + Hailee Steinfeld]
This song's for anybody
Who feels like I did, never the cool kid
This song's for anybody
Who fought their way through, always remained true
This song's for anybody
The one's who trying to get it, the one's who dream it and live it
This song's for anybody
This song, this song, this song, this song, this song, this song

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything

Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
A vision rolling round in my head, but I don’t really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don’t wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
48 hours of love, It's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
Cause every second you’re away feels like forever

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Bridge: Janet Jackson]
Don’t have time to sleep, but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you were missing me
I’ll read between the lines and I sure hope it rains

We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 3: J. Cole (Janet Jackson)]
I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this ends
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep

[Chorus: Janet Jackson (J. Cole) Simultaneous]
Can't stop, yeah  (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)

Certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

No. 08–1448. Argued November 2, 2010—Decided June 27, 2011
Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries, filed a preenforcement challenge to a California law that restricts the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The Federal District Court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.

Held:  The Act does not comport with the First Amendment . Pp. 2–18.

(a) Video games qualify for First Amendment protection. Like protected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through familiar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium. And “the basic principles of freedom of speech … do not vary” with a new and different communication medium. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson , 343 U. S. 495 . The most basic principle—that government lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas, subject matter, or content, Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union , 535 U. S. 564 —is subject to a few limited exceptions for historically unprotected speech, such as obscenity, incitement, and fighting words. But a legislature cannot create new categories of unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the test. See United States v. Stevens , 559 U. S. ___, ___. Unlike the New York law upheld in Ginsberg v. New York , 390 U. S. 629 , California’s Act does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children. Instead, the State wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children. That is unprecedented and mistaken. This country has no tradition of specially restricting children’s access to depictions of violence. And California’s claim that “interactive” video games present special problems, in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome, is unpersuasive. Pp. 2–11.

(b) Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny, i.e., it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V. v. St. Paul , 505 U. S. 377 . California cannot meet that standard. Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively. Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media. Since California has declined to restrict those other media, e.g., Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regulation is wildly underinclusive, raising serious doubts about whether the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. California also cannot show that the Act’s restrictions meet the alleged substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children’s access to violent videos. The video-game industry’s voluntary rating system already accomplishes that to a large extent. Moreover, as a means of assisting parents the Act is greatly overinclusive, since not all of the children who are prohibited from purchasing violent video games have parents who disapprove of their doing so. The Act cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. Pp. 11–18.

556 F. 3d 950, affirmed.

Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Roberts, C. J., joined. Thomas, J., and Breyer, J., filed dissenting opinions.
OPINION
Justice Scalia delivered the Opinion of the CourtWe consider whether a California law imposing restrictions on violent video games comports with the First Amendment .
ICalifornia Assembly Bill 1179 (2005), Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §§1746–1746.5 (West 2009) (Act), prohibits the sale or rental of “violent video games” to minors, and requires their packaging to be labeled “18.” The Act covers games “in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being, if those acts are depicted” in a manner that “[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors,” that is “patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors,” and that “causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.” §1746(d)(1)(A). Violation of the Act is punishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. §1746.3.

Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries, brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. That court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement. Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger , No. C–05–04188 RMW (2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger , 556 F. 3d 950 (CA9 2009), and we granted certiorari, 559 U. S. ____ (2010).
IICalifornia correctly acknowledges that video games qualify for First Amendment protection. The Free Speech Clause exists principally to protect discourse on public matters, but we have long recognized that it is difficult to distinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous to try. “Everyone is familiar with instances of propaganda through fiction. What is one man’s amusement, teaches another’s doctrine.” Winters v. New York , 333 U. S. 507, 510 (1948) . Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player’s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection. Under our Constitution, “esthetic and moral judgments about art and literature … are for the individual to make, not for the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority.” United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. , 529 U. S. 803, 818 (2000) . And whatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing technology, “the basic principles of freedom of speech and the press, like the First Amendment ’s command, do not vary” when a new and different medium for communication appears. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson , 343 U. S. 495, 503 (1952) .

The most basic of those principles is this: “[A]s a general matter, … government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union , 535 U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). There are of course exceptions. “ ‘From 1791 to the present,’ … the First Amendment has ‘permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,’ and has never ‘include[d] a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.’ ” United States v. Stevens , 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting R. A. V. v. St. Paul , 505 U. S. 377, 382–383 (1992) ). These limited areas—such as obscenity, Roth v. United States , 354 U. S. 476, 483 (1957) , incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U. S. 444, 447–449 (1969) (per curiam) , and fighting words, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire , 315 U. S. 568 , 572 (1942)—represent “well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,” id. , at 571–572.

Last Term, in Stevens , we held that new categories of unprotected speech may not be added to the list by a legislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to be tolerated. Stevens concerned a federal statute purporting to criminalize the creation, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty. See 18 U. S. C. §48 (amended 2010). The statute covered depictions “in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed” if that harm to the animal was illegal where the “the creation, sale, or possession t[ook] place,” §48(c)(1). A saving clause largely borrowed from our obscenity jurisprudence, see Miller v. California , 413 U. S. 15, 24 (1973) , exempted depictions with “serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value,” §48(b). We held that statute to be an impermissible content-based restriction on speech. There was no American tradition of forbidding the depiction of animal cruelty—though States have long had laws against committing it.

The Government argued in Stevens that lack of a historical warrant did not matter; that it could create new categories of unprotected speech by applying a “simple balancing test” that weighs the value of a particular category of speech against its social costs and then punishes that category of speech if it fails the test. Stevens , 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). We emphatically rejected that “startling and dangerous” proposition. Ibid. “Maybe there are some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected, but have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 9). But without persuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of proscription, a legislature may not revise the “judgment [of] the American people,” embodied in the First Amendment , “that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 7).

That holding controls this case. 1 As in Stevens , California has tried to make violent-speech regulation look like obscenity regulation by appending a saving clause required for the latter. That does not suffice. Our cases have been clear that the obscenity exception to the First Amendment does not cover whatever a legislature finds shocking, but only depictions of “sexual conduct,” Miller , supra, at 24. See also Cohen v. California , 403 U. S. 15, 20 (1971) ; Roth , supra, at 487, and n. 20.

Stevens was not the first time we have encountered and rejected a State’s attempt to shoehorn speech about violence into obscenity. In Winters , we considered a New York criminal statute “forbid[ding] the massing of stories of bloodshed and lust in such a way as to incite to crime against the person,” 333 U. S., at 514. The New York Court of Appeals upheld the provision as a law against obscenity. “[T]here can be no more precise test of written indecency or obscenity,” it said, “than the continuing and changeable experience of the community as to what types of books are likely to bring about the corruption of public morals or other analogous injury to the public order. ” Id. , at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is of course the same expansive view of governmental power to abridge the freedom of speech based on interest-balancing that we rejected in Stevens . Our opinion in Winters , which concluded that the New York statute failed a heightened vagueness standard applicable to restrictions upon speech entitled to First Amendment protection, 333 U. S., at 517–519, made clear that violence is not part of the obscenity that the Constitution permits to be regulated. The speech reached by the statute contained “no indecency or obscenity in any sense heretofore known to the law.” Id. , at 519.

Because speech about violence is not obscene, it is of no consequence that California’s statute mimics the New York statute regulating obscenity-for-minors that we upheld in Ginsberg v. New York , 390 U. S. 629 (1968) . That case approved a prohibition on the sale to minors of sexual material that would be obscene from the perspective of a child. 2 We held that the legislature could “adjus[t] the definition of obscenity ‘to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in terms of the sexual interests …’ of … minors. ” Id. , at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. New York , 383 U. S. 502, 509 (1966) ). And because “obscenity is not protected expression,” the New York statute could be sustained so long as the legislature’s judgment that the proscribed materials were harmful to children “was not irrational.” 390 U. S., at 641.

The California Act is something else entirely. It does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children. California does not argue that it is empowered to prohibit selling offensively violent works to adults —and it is wise not to, since that is but a hair’s breadth from the argument rejected in Stevens . Instead, it wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children.

That is unprecedented and mistaken. “[M]inors are entitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection, and only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to them.” Erznoznik v. Jacksonville , 422 U. S. 205, 212–213 (1975) (citation omitted). No doubt a State possesses legitimate power to protect children from harm, Ginsberg , supra , at 640–641; Prince v. Massachusetts , 321 U. S. 158, 165 (1944) , but that does not include a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed. “Speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.” Erznoznik , supra, at 213–214. 3

California’s argument would fare better if there were a longstanding tradition in this country of specially restricting children’s access to depictions of violence, but there is none. Certainly the books we give children to read—or read to them when they are younger—contain no shortage of gore. Grimm’s Fairy Tales, for example, are grim indeed. As her just deserts for trying to poison Snow White, the wicked queen is made to dance in red hot slippers “till she fell dead on the floor, a sad example of envy and jealousy.” The Complete Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales 198 (2006 ed.). Cinderella’s evil stepsisters have their eyes pecked out by doves. Id. , at 95. And Hansel and Gretel (children!) kill their captor by baking her in an oven. Id. , at 54.

High-school reading lists are full of similar fare. Homer’s Odysseus blinds Polyphemus the Cyclops by grinding out his eye with a heated stake. The Odyssey of Homer, Book IX, p. 125 (S. Butcher & A. Lang transls. 1909) (“Even so did we seize the fiery-pointed brand and whirled it round in his eye, and the blood flowed about the heated bar. And the breath of the flame singed his eyelids and brows all about, as the ball of the eye burnt away, and the roots thereof crackled in the flame”). In the Inferno, Dante and Virgil watch corrupt politicians struggle to stay submerged beneath a lake of boiling pitch, lest they be skewered by devils above the surface. Canto XXI, pp. 187–189 (A. Mandelbaum transl. Bantam Classic ed. 1982). And Golding’s Lord of the Flies recounts how a schoolboy called Piggy is savagely murdered by other children while marooned on an island. W. Golding, Lord of the Flies 208–209 (1997 ed.). 4

This is not to say that minors’ consumption of violent entertainment has never encountered resistance. In the 1800’s, dime novels depicting crime and “penny dreadfuls” (named for their price and content) were blamed in some quarters for juvenile delinquency. See Brief for Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae 6–7. When motion pictures came along, they became the villains instead. “The days when the police looked upon dime novels as the most dangerous of textbooks in the school for crime are drawing to a close… . They say that the moving picture machine … tends even more than did the dime novel to turn the thoughts of the easily influenced to paths which sometimes lead to prison.” Moving Pictures as Helps to Crime, N. Y. Times, Feb. 21, 1909, quoted in Brief for Cato Institute, at 8. For a time, our Court did permit broad censorship of movies because of their capacity to be “used for evil,” see Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm’n of Ohio , 236 U. S. 230, 242 (1915) , but we eventually reversed course, Joseph Burstyn, Inc. , 343 U. S., at 502; see also Erznoznik , supra, at 212–214 (invalidating a drive-in movies restriction designed to protect children). Radio dramas were next, and then came comic books. Brief for Cato Institute, at 10–11. Many in the late 1940’s and early 1950’s blamed comic books for fostering a “preoccupation with violence and horror” among the young, leading to a rising juvenile crime rate. See Note, Regulation of Comic Books, 68 H arv . L. R ev . 489, 490 (1955). But efforts to convince Congress to restrict comic books failed. Brief for Comic Book Legal Defense Fund as Amicus Curiae 11–15. 5 And, of course, after comic books came television and music lyrics.

California claims that video games present special problems because they are “interactive,” in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome. The latter feature is nothing new: Since at least the publication of The Adventures of You: Sugarcane Island in 1969, young readers of choose-your-own-adventure stories have been able to make decisions that determine the plot by following instructions about which page to turn to. Cf. Interactive Digital Software Assn. v. St. Louis County, 329 F. 3d 954, 957–958 (CA8 2003). As for the argument that video games enable participation in the violent action, that seems to us more a matter of degree than of kind. As Judge Posner has observed, all literature is interactive. “[T]he better it is, the more interactive. Literature when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader’s own.” American Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick , 244 F. 3d 572, 577 (CA7 2001) (striking down a similar restriction on violent video games).

Justice Alito has done considerable independent re-search to identify, see post , at 14–15, nn. 13–18, video games in which “the violence is astounding,” post , at 14. “Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces. . . . Blood gushes, splatters, and pools.” Ibid. Justice Alito recounts all these disgusting video games in order to disgust us—but disgust is not a valid basis for restricting expression. And the same is true of Justice Alito ’s description, post , at 14–15, of those video games he has discovered that have a racial or ethnic motive for their violence—“ ‘ethnic cleansing’ [of] . . . African Americans, Latinos, or Jews.” To what end does he relate this? Does it somehow increase the “aggressiveness” that California wishes to suppress? Who knows? But it does arouse the reader’s ire, and the reader’s desire to put an end to this horrible message. Thus, ironically, Justice Alito ’s argument highlights the precise danger posed by the California Act: that the ideas expressed by speech—whether it be violence, or gore, or racism—and not its objective effects, may be the real reason for governmental proscription.
IIIBecause the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny—that is, unless it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V. , 505 U. S., at 395. The State must specifically identify an “actual problem” in need of solving, Playboy , 529 U. S., at 822–823, and the curtailment of free speech must be actually necessary to the solution, see R. A. V. , supra, at 395. That is a demanding standard. “It is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.” Playboy , supra, at 818.

California cannot meet that standard. At the outset, it acknowledges that it cannot show a direct causal link between violent video games and harm to minors. Rather, relying upon our decision in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC , 512 U. S. 622 (1994) , the State claims that it need not produce such proof because the legislature can make a predictive judgment that such a link exists, based on competing psychological studies. But reliance on Turner Broadcasting is misplaced. That decision applied intermediate scrutiny to a content-neutral regulation. Id. , at 661–662. California’s burden is much higher, and because it bears the risk of uncertainty, see Playboy , supra, at 816–817, ambiguous proof will not suffice.

The State’s evidence is not compelling. California relies primarily on the research of Dr. Craig Anderson and a few other research psychologists whose studies purport to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children. These studies have been rejected by every court to consider them, 6 and with good reason: They do not prove that violent video games cause minors to act aggressively (which would at least be a beginning). Instead, “[n]early all of the research is based on correlation, not evidence of causation, and most of the studies suffer from significant, admitted flaws in methodology.” Video Software Dealers Assn. 556 F. 3d, at 964. They show at best some correlation between exposure to violent entertainment and minuscule real-world effects, such as children’s feeling more aggressive or making louder noises in the few minutes after playing a violent game than after playing a nonviolent game. 7

Even taking for granted Dr. Anderson’s conclusions that violent video games produce some effect on children’s feelings of aggression, those effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media. In his testimony in a similar lawsuit, Dr. Anderson admitted that the “effect sizes” of children’s exposure to violent video games are “about the same” as that produced by their exposure to violence on television. App. 1263. And he admits that the same effects have been found when children watch cartoons starring Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner, id., at 1304, or when they play video games like Sonic the Hedgehog that are rated “E” (appropriate for all ages), id., at 1270, or even when they “vie[w] a picture of a gun,” id., at 1315–1316. 8

Of course, California has (wisely) declined to restrict Saturday morning cartoons, the sale of games rated for young children, or the distribution of pictures of guns. The consequence is that its regulation is wildly underinclusive when judged against its asserted justification, which in our view is alone enough to defeat it. Underinclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. See City of Ladue v. Gilleo , 512 U. S. 43, 51 (1994) ; Florida Star v. B. J. F. , 491 U. S. 524, 540 (1989) . Here, California has singled out the purveyors of video games for disfavored treatment—at least when compared to booksellers, cartoonists, and movie producers—and has given no persuasive reason why.

The Act is also seriously underinclusive in another respect—and a respect that renders irrelevant the contentions of the concurrence and the dissents that video games are qualitatively different from other portrayals of violence. The California Legislature is perfectly willing to leave this dangerous, mind-altering material in the hands of children so long as one parent (or even an aunt or uncle) says it’s OK. And there are not even any requirements as to how this parental or avuncular relationship is to be verified; apparently the child’s or putative parent’s, aunt’s, or uncle’s say-so suffices. That is not how one addresses a serious social problem.

California claims that the Act is justified in aid of parental authority: By requiring that the purchase of violent video games can be made only by adults, the Act ensures that parents can decide what games are appropriate. At the outset, we note our doubts that punishing third parties for conveying protected speech to children just in case their parents disapprove of that speech is a proper governmental means of aiding parental authority. Accepting that position would largely vitiate the rule that “only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to [minors].” Erznoznik , 422 U. S., at 212–213.

But leaving that aside, California cannot show that the Act’s restrictions meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children’s access to violent video games but cannot do so. The video-game industry has in place a voluntary rating system designed to inform consumers about the content of games. The system, implemented by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), assigns age-specific ratings to each video game submitted: EC (Early Childhood); E (Everyone); E10+ (Everyone 10 and older); T (Teens); M (17 and older); and AO (Adults Only—18 and older). App. 86. The Video Software Dealers Association encourages retailers to prominently display information about the ESRB system in their stores; to refrain from renting or selling adults-only games to minors; and to rent or sell “M” rated games to minors only with parental consent. Id., at 47. In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that, as a result of this system, “the video game industry outpaces the movie and music industries” in “(1) restricting target-marketing of mature-rated products to children; (2) clearly and prominently disclosing rating information; and (3) re-stricting children’s access to mature-rated products at retail.” FTC, Report to Congress, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 30 (Dec. 2009), online at http:// www.ftc.gov / os/ 2009 / 12/ P994511violententertainment.pdf (as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (FTC Report). This system does much to ensure that minors cannot purchase seriously violent games on their own, and that parents who care about the matter can readily evaluate the games their children bring home. Filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents’ control can hardly be a compelling state interest. 9

And finally, the Act’s purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive. Not all of the children who are forbidden to purchase violent video games on their own have parents who care whether they purchase violent video games. While some of the legislation’s effect may indeed be in support of what some parents of the restricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in support of what the State thinks parents ought to want. This is not the narrow tailoring to “assisting parents” that restriction of First Amendment rights requires.

*  *  *

California’s effort to regulate violent video games is the latest episode in a long series of failed attempts to censor violent entertainment for minors. While we have pointed out above that some of the evidence brought forward to support the harmfulness of video games is unpersuasive, we do not mean to demean or disparage the concerns that underlie the attempt to regulate them—concerns that may and doubtless do prompt a good deal of parental oversight. We have no business passing judgment on the view of the California Legislature that violent video games (or, for that matter, any other forms of speech) corrupt the young or harm their moral development. Our task is only to say whether or not such works constitute a “well-defined and narrowly limited clas[s] of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,” Chaplinsky , 315 U. S., at 571–572 (the answer plainly is no); and if not, whether the regulation of such works is justified by that high degree of necessity we have described as a compelling state interest (it is not). Even where the protection of children is the object, the constitutional limits on governmental action apply.

California’s legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious social problem and (2) helping concerned parents control their children. Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520, 546 (1993) . As a means of protecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only because it excludes portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto. And as a means of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First Amendment rights of young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles) think violent video games are a harmless pastime. And the overbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the other. Legislation such as this, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot survive strict scrutiny.

We affirm the judgment below.

It is so ordered.
Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring in the judgment.The California statute that is before us in this case represents a pioneering effort to address what the state legislature and others regard as a potentially serious social problem: the effect of exceptionally violent video games on impressionable minors, who often spend countless hours immersed in the alternative worlds that these games create. Although the California statute is well intentioned, its terms are not framed with the precision that the Constitution demands, and I therefore agree with the Court that this particular law cannot be sustained.

I disagree, however, with the approach taken in the Court's opinion. In considering the application of unchanging constitutional principles to new and rapidly evolving technology, this Court should proceed with caution. We should make every effort to understand the new technology. We should take into account the possibility that developing technology may have important societal implications that will become apparent only with time. We should not jump to the conclusion that new technology is fundamentally the same as some older thing with which we are familiar. And we should not hastily dismiss the judgment of legislators, who may be in a better position than we are to assess the implications of new technology. The opinion of the Court exhibits none of this caution.

In the view of the Court, all those concerned about the effects of violent video games—federal and state legislators, educators, social scientists, and parents—are unduly fearful, for violent video games really present no serious problem. See ante, at 2737-2739, 2740-2741. Spending hour upon hour controlling the actions of a character who guns down scores of innocent victims is not different in ""kind"" from reading a description of violence in a work of literature. See ante, at 2737-2738.

The Court is sure of this; I am not. There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show.
IRespondents in this case, representing the video-game industry, ask us to strike down the California law on two grounds: The broad ground adopted by the Court and the narrower ground that the law's definition of ""violent video game,"" see Cal. Civ.Code Ann. § 1746(d)(1)(A) (West 2009), is impermissibly vague. See Brief for Respondents 23-61. Because I agree with the latter argument, I see no need to reach the broader First Amendment issues addressed by the Court.[1]
ADue process requires that laws give people of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). The lack of such notice in a law that regulates expression ""raises special First Amendment concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free speech."" Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 871-872, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). Vague laws force potential speakers to ""`steer far wider of the unlawful zone' . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked."" Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964) (quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958)). While ""perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity,"" Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 794, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989), ""government may regulate in the area"" of First Amendment freedoms ""only with narrow specificity,"" NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963); see also Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). These principles apply to laws that regulate expression for the purpose of protecting children. See Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 390 U.S. 676, 689, 88 S.Ct. 1298, 20 L.Ed.2d 225 (1968).

Here, the California law does not define ""violent video games"" with the ""narrow specificity"" that the Constitution demands. In an effort to avoid First Amendment problems, the California Legislature modeled its violent video game statute on the New York law that this Court upheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968)—a law that prohibited the sale of certain sexually related materials to minors, see id., at 631-633, 88 S.Ct. 1274. But the California Legislature departed from the Ginsberg model in an important respect, and the legislature overlooked important differences between the materials falling within the scope of the two statutes.
BThe law at issue in Ginsberg prohibited the sale to minors of materials that were deemed ""harmful to minors,"" and the law defined ""harmful to minors"" simply by adding the words ""for minors"" to each element of the definition of obscenity set out in what were then the Court's leading obscenity decisions, see Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957), and Book Named ""John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure"" v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966).

Seeking to bring its violent video game law within the protection of Ginsberg, the California Legislature began with the obscenity test adopted in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), a decision that revised the obscenity tests previously set out in Roth and Memoirs. The legislature then made certain modifications to accommodate the aim of the violent video game law.

Under Miller, an obscenity statute must contain a thresh-old limitation that restricts the statute's scope to specifically described ""hard core"" materials. See 413 U.S., at 23-25, 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607. Materials that fall within this ""hard core"" category may be deemed to be obscene if three additional requirements are met:

(1) an ""average person, applying contemporary community standards [must] find . . . the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest"";

(2) ""the work [must] depic[t] or describ[e], in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and""

(3) ""the work, taken as a whole, [must] lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."" Id., at 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Adapting these standards, the California law imposes the following threshold limitation: ""[T]he range of options available to a player [must] includ[e] killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being."" § 1746(d)(1). Any video game that meets this threshold test is subject to the law's restrictions if it also satisfies three further requirements:
(i) A reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.

""(ii) It is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors.

""(iii) It causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors."" § 1746(d)(1)(A).[2]CThe first important difference between the Ginsberg law and the California violent video game statute concerns their respective threshold requirements. As noted, the Ginsberg law built upon the test for adult obscenity, and the current adult obscenity test, which was set out in Miller, requires an obscenity statute to contain a threshold limitation that restricts the statute's coverage to specifically defined ""hard core"" depictions. See 413 U.S., at 23-25, 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607. The Miller Court gave as an example a statute that applies to only ""[p]atently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts,"" ""masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals."" Id., at 25, 93 S.Ct. 2607. The Miller Court clearly viewed this threshold limitation as serving a vital notice function. ""We are satisfied,"" the Court wrote, ""that these specific prerequisites will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials that his public and commercial activities may bring prosecution."" Id., at 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607; see also Reno, supra, at 873, 117 S.Ct. 2329 (observing that Miller's threshold limitation ""reduces the vagueness inherent in the open-ended term `patently offensive'"").[3]

By contrast, the threshold requirement of the California law does not perform the narrowing function served by the limitation in Miller. At least when Miller was decided, depictions of ""hard core"" sexual conduct were not a common feature of mainstream entertainment. But nothing similar can be said about much of the conduct covered by the California law. It provides that a video game cannot qualify as ""violent"" unless ""the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being."" § 1746(d)(1).

For better or worse, our society has long regarded many depictions of killing and maiming[4] as suitable features of popular entertainment, including entertainment that is widely available to minors. The California law's threshold requirement would more closely resemble the limitation in Miller if it targeted a narrower class of graphic depictions.

Because of this feature of the California law's threshold test, the work of providing fair notice is left in large part to the three requirements that follow, but those elements are also not up to the task. In drafting the violent video game law, the California Legislature could have made its own judgment regarding the kind and degree of violence that is acceptable in games played by minors (or by minors in particular age groups). Instead, the legislature relied on undefined societal or community standards.

One of the three elements at issue here refers expressly to ""prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors."" § 1746(d)(1)(A)(ii). Another element points in the same direction, asking whether ""[a] reasonable person, considering [a] game as a whole,"" would find that it ""appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors."" § 1746(d)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).

The terms ""deviant"" and ""morbid"" are not defined in the statute, and California offers no reason to think that its courts would give the terms anything other than their ordinary meaning. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 5 (arguing that ""[a] reasonable person can make this judgment through . . . a common understanding and definition of the applicable terms""). I therefore assume that ""deviant"" and ""morbid"" carry the meaning that they convey in ordinary speech. The adjective ""deviant"" ordinarily means ""deviating . . . from some accepted norm,"" and the term ""morbid"" means ""of, relating to, or characteristic of disease."" Webster's 618, 1469. A ""deviant or morbid interest"" in violence, therefore, appears to be an interest that deviates from what is regarded—presumably in accordance with some generally accepted standard—as normal and healthy. Thus, the application of the California law is heavily dependent on the identification of generally accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment for minors.

The California Legislature seems to have assumed that these standards are sufficiently well known so that a person of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice as to whether the kind and degree of violence in a particular game is enough to qualify the game as ""violent."" And because the Miller test looks to community standards, the legislature may have thought that the use of undefined community standards in the violent video game  law would not present vagueness problems.

There is a critical difference, however, between obscenity laws and laws regulating violence in entertainment. By the time of this Court's landmark obscenity cases in the 1960's, obscenity had long been prohibited, see Roth, 354 U.S., at 484-485, 77 S.Ct. 1304, and this experience had helped to shape certain generally accepted norms concerning expression related to sex.

There is no similar history regarding expression related to violence. As the Court notes, classic literature contains descriptions of great violence, and even children's stories sometimes depict very violent scenes. See ante, at 2736-2737.

Although our society does not generally regard all depictions of violence as suitable for children or adolescents, the prevalence of violent depictions in children's literature and entertainment creates numerous opportunities for reasonable people to disagree about which depictions may excite ""deviant"" or ""morbid"" impulses. See Edwards & Berman, Regulating Violence on Television, 89 Nw. U.L.Rev. 1487, 1523 (1995) (observing that the Miller test would be difficult to apply to violent expression because ""there is nothing even approaching a consensus on low-value violence"").

Finally, the difficulty of ascertaining the community standards incorporated into the California law is compounded by the legislature's decision to lump all minors together. The California law draws no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority.

In response to a question at oral argument, the attorney defending the constitutionality of the California law said that the State would accept a narrowing construction of the law under which the law's references to ""minors"" would be interpreted to refer to the oldest minors—that is, those just short of 18. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12. However, ""it is not within our power to construe and narrow state laws."" Grayned, 408 U.S., at 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294. We can only ""`extrapolate [their] allowable meaning'"" from the statutory text and authoritative interpretations of similar laws by courts of the State. Ibid. (quoting Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U.S. 157, 174, 82 S.Ct. 248, 7 L.Ed.2d 207 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment)).

In this case, California has not provided any evidence that the California Legislature intended the law to be limited in this way, or cited any decisions from its courts that would support an ""oldest minors"" construction.[5]

For these reasons, I conclude that the California violent video game law fails to provide the fair notice that the Constitution requires. And I would go no further. I would not express any view on whether a properly drawn statute would or would not survive First Amendment scrutiny. We should address that question only if and when it is necessary to do so.
IIHaving outlined how I would decide this case, I will now briefly elaborate on my reasons for questioning the wisdom of the Court's approach. Some of these reasons are touched upon by the dissents, and while I am not prepared at this time to go as far as either Justice THOMAS or Justice BREYER, they raise valid concerns.
AThe Court is wrong in saying that the holding in United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010), ""controls this case."" Ante, at 2734. First, the statute in Stevens differed sharply from the statute at issue here. Stevens struck down a law that broadly prohibited any person from creating, selling, or possessing depictions of animal cruelty for commercial gain. The California law involved here, by contrast, is limited to the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The California law imposes no restriction on the creation of violent video games, or on the possession of such games by anyone, whether above or below the age of 18. The California law does not regulate the sale or rental of violent games by adults. And the California law does not prevent parents and certain other close relatives from buying or renting violent games for their children or other young relatives if they see fit.

Second, Stevens does not support the proposition that a law like the one at issue must satisfy strict scrutiny. The portion of Stevens on which the Court relies rejected the Government's contention that depictions of animal cruelty were categorically outside the range of any First Amendment protection. 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1582. Going well beyond Stevens, the Court now holds that any law that attempts to prevent minors from purchasing violent video games must satisfy strict scrutiny instead of the more lenient standard applied in Ginsberg, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195, our most closely related precedent. As a result of today's decision, a State may prohibit the sale to minors of what Ginsberg described as ""girlie magazines,"" but a State must surmount a formidable (and perhaps insurmountable) obstacle if it wishes to prevent children from purchasing the most violent and depraved video games imaginable.

Third, Stevens expressly left open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute targeting depictions of animal cruelty might be compatible with the First Amendment. See 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1592. In this case, the Court's sweeping opinion will likely be read by many, both inside and outside the video-game industry, as suggesting that no regulation of minors' access to violent video games is allowed—at least without supporting evidence that may not be realistically obtainable given the nature of the phenomenon in question.
BThe Court's opinion distorts the effect of the California law. I certainly agree with the Court that the government has no ""free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed,"" ante, at 2736, but the California law does not exercise such a power. If parents want their child to have a violent video game, the California law does not interfere with that parental prerogative. Instead, the California law reinforces parental decisionmaking in exactly the same way as the New York statute upheld in Ginsberg. Under both laws, minors are prevented from purchasing certain materials; and under both laws, parents are free to supply their children with these items if that is their wish.

Citing the video-game industry's voluntary rating system, the Court argues that the California law does not ""meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children's access to violent video games but cannot do so."" Ante, at 2740. The Court does not mention the fact that the industry adopted this system in response to the threat of federal regulation, Brief for Activision Blizzard, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 7-10, a threat that the Court's opinion may now be seen as largely eliminating. Nor does the Court acknowledge that compliance with this system at the time of the enactment of the California law left much to be desired[6]— or that future enforcement may decline if the video-game industry perceives that any threat of government regulation has vanished. Nor does the Court note, as Justice BREYER points out, see post, at 2767 (dissenting opinion), that many parents today are simply not able to monitor their children's use of computers and gaming devices.
CFinally, the Court is far too quick to dismiss the possibility that the experience of playing video games (and the effects on minors of playing violent video games) may be very different from anything that we have seen before. Any assessment of the experience of playing video games must take into account certain characteristics of the video games that are now on the market and those that are likely to be available in the near future.

Today's most advanced video games create realistic alternative worlds in which millions of players immerse themselves for hours on end. These games feature visual imagery and sounds that are strikingly realistic, and in the near future video-game graphics may be virtually indistinguishable from actual video footage.[7] Many of the games already on the market can produce high definition images,[8] and it is predicted that it will not be long before video-game images will be seen in three dimensions.[9] It is also forecast that video games will soon provide sensory feedback.[10] By wearing a special vest or other device, a player will be able to experience physical sensations supposedly felt by a character  on the screen.[11] Some amici who support respondents foresee the day when ""`virtual-reality shoot-`em-ups'"" will allow children to ""`actually feel the splatting blood from the blown-off head'"" of a victim. Brief for Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press et al. as Amici Curiae 29 (quoting H. Schechter, Savage Pastimes 18 (2005)).

Persons who play video games also have an unprecedented ability to participate in the events that take place in the virtual worlds that these games create. Players can create their own video-game characters and can use photos to produce characters that closely resemble actual people. A person playing a sophisticated game can make a multitude of choices and can thereby alter the course of the action in the game. In addition, the means by which players control the action in video games now bear a closer relationship to the means by which people control action in the real world. While the action in older games was often directed with buttons or a joystick, players dictate the action in newer games by engaging in the same motions that they desire a character in the game to perform.[12] For example, a player who wants a video-game character to swing a baseball bat—either to hit a ball or smash a skull—could bring that about by simulating the motion of actually swinging a bat.

These present-day and emerging characteristics of video games must be considered together with characteristics of the violent games that have already been marketed.

In some of these games, the violence is astounding.[13] Victims by the dozens are killed with every imaginable implement, including machine guns, shotguns, clubs, hammers, axes, swords, and chainsaws. Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces. They cry out in agony and beg for mercy. Blood gushes, splatters, and pools. Severed body parts and gobs of human remains are graphically shown. In some games, points are awarded based, not only on the number of victims killed, but on the killing technique employed.

It also appears that there is no antisocial theme too base for some in the video-game industry to exploit. There are games in which a player can take on the identity and reenact the killings carried out by the perpetrators of the murders at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech.[14] The objective of one game is to rape a mother and her daughters;[15] in another, the goal is to rape Native American women.[16] There is a game in which players engage in ""ethnic cleansing"" and can choose to gun down African-Americans, Latinos, or Jews.[17] In still another game, players attempt to fire a rifle shot into the head of President Kennedy as his motorcade passes by the Texas School Book Depository.[18]

If the technological characteristics of the sophisticated games that are likely to be available in the near future are combined with the characteristics of the most violent games already marketed, the result will be games that allow troubled teens to experience in an extraordinarily personal and vivid way what it would be like to carry out unspeakable acts of violence.

The Court is untroubled by this possibility. According to the Court, the ""interactive"" nature of video games is ""nothing new"" because ""all literature is interactive."" Ante, at 2738. Disagreeing with this assessment, the International Game Developers Association (IGDA)—a group that presumably understands the nature of video games and that supports respondents— tells us that video games are ""far more concretely interactive."" Brief for IGDA et al. as Amici Curiae 3. And on this point, the game developers are surely correct.

It is certainly true, as the Court notes, that ""`[l]iterature, when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader's own.'"" Ante, at 2738 (quoting American Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick, 244 F.3d 572, 577 (C.A.7 2001)). But only an extraordinarily imaginative reader who reads a description of a killing in a literary work will experience that event as vividly as he might if he played the role of the killer in a video game. To take an example, think of a person who reads the passage in Crime and Punishment in which Raskolnikov kills the old pawn broker with an axe. See F. Dostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment 78 (Modern Library ed.1950). Compare that reader with a video-game player who creates an avatar that bears his own image; who sees a realistic image of the victim and the scene of the killing in high definition and in three dimensions; who is forced to decide whether or not to kill the victim and decides to do so; who then pretends to grasp an axe, to raise it above the head of the victim, and then to bring it down; who hears the thud of the axe hitting her head and her cry of pain; who sees her split skull and feels the sensation of blood on his face and hands. For most people, the two experiences will not be the same.[19]

When all of the characteristics of video games are taken into account, there is certainly a reasonable basis for thinking that the experience of playing a video game may be quite different from the experience of reading a book, listening to a radio broadcast, or viewing a movie. And if this is so, then for at least some minors, the effects of playing violent video games may also be quite different. The Court acts prematurely in dismissing this possibility out of hand.

For all these reasons, I would hold only that the particular law at issue here fails to provide the clear notice that the Constitution requires. I would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem. If differently framed statutes are enacted by the States or by the Federal Government, we can consider the constitutionality of those laws when cases challenging them are presented to us.
Justice THOMAS, dissenting.The Court's decision today does not comport with the original public understanding of the First Amendment. The majority strikes down, as facially unconstitutional, a state law that prohibits the direct sale or rental of certain video games to minors because the law ""abridg[es] the freedom of speech."" U.S. Const., Amdt. 1. But I do not think the First Amendment stretches that far. The practices and beliefs of the founding generation establish that ""the freedom of speech,"" as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents or guardians. I would hold that the law at issue is not facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment, and reverse and remand for further proceedings.[1]
IWhen interpreting a constitutional provision, ""the goal is to discern the most likely public understanding of [that] provision at the time it was adopted."" McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 3072, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Because the Constitution is a written instrument, ""its meaning does not alter."" McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 359, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). ""That which it meant when adopted, it means now."" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

As originally understood, the First Amendment's protection against laws ""abridging the freedom of speech"" did not extend to all speech. ""There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem."" Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942); see also United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S.  ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 1582-1583, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010). Laws regulating such speech do not ""abridg[e] the freedom of speech"" because such speech is understood to fall outside ""the freedom of speech."" See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 245-246, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002).

In my view, the ""practices and beliefs held by the Founders"" reveal another category of excluded speech: speech to minor children bypassing their parents. McIntyre, supra, at 360, 115 S.Ct. 1511. The historical evidence shows that the founding generation believed parents had absolute authority over their minor children and expected parents to use that authority to direct the proper development of their children. It would be absurd to suggest that such a society understood ""the freedom of speech"" to include a right to speak to minors (or a corresponding right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents. Cf. Brief for Common Sense Media as Amicus Curiae 12-15. The founding generation would not have considered it an abridgment of ""the freedom of speech"" to support parental authority by restricting speech that bypasses minors' parents.
AAttitudes toward children were in a state of transition around the time that the States ratified the Bill of Rights. A complete understanding of the founding generation's views on children and the parent-child relationship must therefore begin roughly a century earlier, in colonial New England.

In the Puritan tradition common in the New England Colonies, fathers ruled families with absolute authority. ""The patriarchal family was the basic building block of Puritan society."" S. Mintz, Huck's Raft 13 (2004) (hereinafter Mintz); see also R. MacDonald, Literature for Children in England and America from 1646 to 1774, p. 7 (1982) (hereinafter MacDonald). The Puritans rejected many customs, such as godparenthood, that they considered inconsistent with the patriarchal structure. Mintz 13.

Part of the father's absolute power was the right and duty ""to fill his children's minds with knowledge and . . . make them apply their knowledge in right action."" E. Morgan, The Puritan Family 97 (rev. ed.1966) (herein-after Morgan). Puritans thought children were ""innately sinful and that parents' primary task was to suppress their children's natural depravity."" S. Mintz & S. Kellogg, Domestic Revolutions 2 (1988) (hereinafter Mintz & Kellogg); see also B. Wadsworth, The Well-Ordered Family 55 (1712) (""Children should not be left to themselves . . . to do as they please;. . . not being fit to govern themselves""); C. Mather, A Family Well-Ordered 38 (1699). Accordingly, parents were not to let their children read ""vain Books, profane Ballads, and filthy Songs"" or ""fond and amorous Romances, . . . fabulous Histories of Giants, the bombast Achievements of Knight Errantry, and the like."" The History of Genesis, pp. vi-vii (3d ed. corrected 1708).

This conception of parental authority was reflected in laws at that time. In the Massachusetts Colony, for example, it was unlawful for tavern keepers (or anyone else) to entertain children without their parents' consent. 2 Records and Files of the Quarterly Courts of Essex County, Massachusetts, p. 180 (1912); 4 id., at 237, 275 (1914); 5 id., at 143 (1916); see also Morgan 146. And a ""stubborn or rebellious son"" of 16 years or more committed a capital offense if he disobeyed ""the voice of his Father, or the voice of his Mother."" The Laws and Liberties of Massachusetts 6 (1648) (reprint M. Farrand ed.1929); see also J. Kamensky, Governing the Tongue 102, n. 14 (1997) (citing similar laws in the Connecticut, New Haven, Plymouth, and New Hampshire Colonies in the late 1600's).
BIn the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, attitudes towards children changed. See, e.g., J. Reinier, From Virtue to Character: American Childhood, 1775-1850, p. 1 (1996) (hereinafter Reinier). Children came to be seen less as innately sinful and more as blank slates requiring careful and deliberate development. But the same overarching principles remained. Parents continued to have both the right and duty to ensure the proper development of their children. They exercised significant authority over their children, including control over the books that children read. And laws at the time continued to reflect strong support for parental authority and the sense that children were not fit to govern themselves.
1The works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were a driving force behind the changed understanding of children and childhood. See Reinier 2-5; H. Brewer, By Birth or Consent 97 (2005) (hereinafter Brewer); K. Calvert, Children in the House 59-60 (1992) (hereinafter Calvert). Locke taught that children's minds were blank slates and that parents therefore had to be careful and deliberate about what their children were told and observed. Parents had only themselves to blame if, ""by humouring and cockering"" their children, they ""poison'd the fountain"" and later ""taste[d] the bitter waters."" Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1692), in 37 English Philosophers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries 27-28 (C. Eliot ed.1910). All vices, he explained, were sowed by parents and ""those about children."" Id., at 29. Significantly, Locke did not suggest circumscribing parental authority but rather articulated a new basis for it. Rousseau disagreed with Locke in important respects, but his philosophy was similarly premised on parental control over a child's development. Although Rousseau advocated that children should be allowed to develop naturally, he instructed that the environment be directed by ""a tutor who is given total control over the child and who removes him from society, from all competing sources of authority and influence."" J. Fliegelman, Prodigals and Pilgrims 30 (1982) (hereinafter Fliegelman); see also Reinier 15.

These writings received considerable attention in America. Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and his Some Thoughts Concerning Education were significantly more popular than his Two Treatises of Government, according to a study of 92 colonial libraries between 1700 and 1776. Lundberg & May, The Enlightened Reader in America, 28 American Quarterly 262, 273 (1976) (hereinafter Lundberg). And Rousseau's Emile, a treatise on education, was more widely advertised and distributed than his political work, The Social Contract. Fliegelman 29; see also Lundberg 285. In general, the most popular books in the Colonies on the eve of the American Revolution were not political discourses but ones concerned with child rearing. See Mintz & Kellogg 45.
2Locke's and Rousseau's writings fostered a new conception of childhood. Children were increasingly viewed as malleable creatures, and childhood came to be seen as an important period of growth, development, and preparation for adulthood. See Mintz & Kellogg 17, 21, 47; M. Grossberg, Governing the Hearth 8 (1985) (hereinafter Grossberg). Noah Webster, called the father of American education, wrote that ""[t]he impressions received in early life usually form the characters of individuals."" On the Education of Youth in America (1790) (hereinafter Webster), in Essays on Education in the Early Republic 43 (F. Rudolph ed.1965) (hereinafter Rudolph); cf. Slater, Noah Webster: Founding Father of American Scholarship and Education, in Noah Webster's First Edition of an American Dictionary of the English Language (1967). Elizabeth Smith, sister-in-law to John Adams, similarly wrote: ""The Infant Mind, I beleive[,] is a blank, that eassily receives any impression."" M. Norton, Liberty's Daughters 101 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (hereinafter Norton); see also S. Doggett, A Discourse on Education (1796) (hereinafter Doggett), in Rudolph 151 (""[I]n early youth, . . . every power and capacity is pliable and susceptible of any direction or impression""); J. Abbott, The Mother at Home 2 (1834) (hereinafter Abbott) (""What impressions can be more strong, and more lasting, than those received upon the mind in the freshness and the susceptibility of youth"").

Children lacked reason and decisionmaking ability. They ""have not Judgment or Will of their own,"" John Adams noted. Letter to James Sullivan (May 26, 1776), in 4 Papers of John Adams 210 (R. Taylor ed.1979); see also Vol. 1 1787: Drafting the Constitution, p. 229 (W. Benton ed.1986) (quoting Gouvernor Morris in James Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention explaining that children do not vote because they ""want prudence"" and ""have no will of their own""). Children's ""utter incapacity"" rendered them ""almost wholly at the mercy of their Parents or Instructors for a set of habits to regulate their whole conduct through life."" J. Burgh, Thoughts on Education 7 (1749) (hereinafter Burgh).

This conception of childhood led to great concern about influences on children. ""Youth are ever learning to do what they see others around them doing, and these imitations grow into habits."" Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also B. Rush, A Plan for the Establishment of Public Schools (1786) (hereinafter Rush), in Rudolph 16 (""The vices of young people are generally learned from each other""); Webster, in Rudolph 58 (""[C]hildren, artless and unsuspecting, resign their hearts to any person whose manners are agreeable and whose conduct is respectable""). Books therefore advised parents ""not to put children in the way of those whom you dare not trust."" L. Child, The Mother's Book 149 (1831) (hereinafter Child); see also S. Coontz, The Social Origins of Private Life 149-150 (1988) (noting that it was ""considered dangerous to leave children to the supervision of servants or apprentices"").

As a result, it was widely accepted that children needed close monitoring and carefully planned development. See B. Wishy, The Child and the Republic 24-25, 32 (1968) (hereinafter Wishy); Grossberg 8. Managing the young mind was considered ""infinitely important."" Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also A. MacLeod, A Moral Tale 72-73 (1975) (hereinafter MacLeod). In an essay on the education of youth in America, Noah Webster described the human mind as ""a rich field, which, without constant care, will ever be covered with a luxuriant growth of weeds."" Rudolph 54. He advocated sheltering children from ""every low-bred, drunken, immoral character"" and keeping their minds ""untainted till their reasoning faculties have acquired strength and the good principles which may be planted in their minds have taken deep root."" Id., at 63; see also Rush, in id., at 16 (""[T]he most useful citizens have  been formed from those youth who have never known or felt their own wills till they were one and twenty years of age""); Burgh 7 (""[T]he souls of Youth are more immediately committed to the care of Parents and Instructors than even those of a People are to their Pastor"").

The Revolution only amplified these concerns. The Republic would require virtuous citizens, which necessitated proper training from childhood. See Mintz 54, 71; MacLeod 40; Saxton, French and American Childhoods, in Children and Youth in a New Nation 69 (J. Marten ed.2009) (hereinafter Marten); see also W. Cardell, Story of Jack Halyard, pp. xv-xvi (30th ed. 1834) (hereinafter Cardell) (""[T]he glory and efficacy of our institutions will soon rest with those who are growing up to succede us""). Children were ""the pivot of the moral world,"" and their proper development was ""a subject of as high interest, as any to which the human mind ha[d] ever been called."" Id., at xvi.
3Based on these views of childhood, the founding generation understood parents to have a right and duty to govern their children's growth. Parents were expected to direct the development and education of their children and ensure that bad habits did not take root. See Calvert 58-59; MacLeod 72; Mintz & Kellogg 23. They were responsible for instilling ""moral prohibitions, behavioral standards, and a capacity for self-government that would prepare a child for the outside world."" Mintz & Kellogg 58; see also Youth's Companion, Apr. 16, 1827, p. 1 (hereinafter Youth's Companion) (""Let [children's] minds be formed, their hearts prepared, and their characters moulded for the scenes and the duties of a brighter day""). In short, ""[h]ome and family bore the major responsibility for the moral training of children and thus, by implication, for the moral health of the nation."" MacLeod 29; see also Introduction, in Marten 6; Reinier, p. xi; Smith, Autonomy and Affection: Parents and Children in Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake Families, in Growing up in America 54 (N. Hiner & J. Hawes eds. 1985).

This conception of parental rights and duties was exemplified by Thomas Jefferson's approach to raising children. He wrote letters to his daughters constantly and often gave specific instructions about what the children should do. See, e.g., Letter to Martha Jefferson (Nov. 28, 1783), in S. Randolph, The Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson 44 (1939) (dictating her daily schedule of music, dancing, drawing, and studying); Letter to Martha Jefferson (Dec. 22, 1783), in id., at 45-46 (""I do not wish you to be gaily clothed at this time of life . . . . [A]bove all things and at all times let your clothes be neat, whole, and properly put on""). Jefferson expected his daughter, Martha, to write ""by every post"" and instructed her, ""Inform me what books you read [and] what tunes you learn."" Letter (Nov. 28, 1783), in id., at 44. He took the same approach with his nephew, Peter Carr, after Carr's father died. See Letter (Aug. 19, 1785), in 8 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 405-408 (J. Boyd ed.1953) (detailing a course of reading and exercise, and asking for monthly progress reports describing ""in what manner you employ every hour in the day""); see also 3 Dictionary of Virginia Biography 29 (2006).

Jefferson's rigorous management of his charges was not uncommon. ""[M]uch evidence indicates that mothers and fathers both believed in giving their children a strict upbringing, enforcing obedience to their commands and stressing continued subjection to the parental will."" Norton 96. Two parenting books published in the 1830's gave prototypical advice. In The Mother's Book, Lydia Child advised that ""[t]he first and most important step in management is, that whatever a mother says, always must be done."" Child 26. John Abbott, the author of The Mother at Home, likewise advised that ""[o]bedience is absolutely essential to proper family government."" Abbott 18. Echoing Locke, Abbott warned that parents who indulged a child's ""foolish and unreasonable wishes"" would doom that child to be indulgent in adulthood. Id., at 16.

The concept of total parental control over children's lives extended into the schools. ""The government both of families and schools should be absolute,"" declared Noah Webster. Rudolph 57-58. Dr. Benjamin Rush concurred: ""In the education of youth, let the authority of our masters be as absolute as possible."" Id., at 16. Through the doctrine of in loco parentis, teachers assumed the ""`sacred dut[y] of parents . . . to train up and qualify their children'"" and exercised the same authority ""`to command obedience, to control stubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform bad habits.'"" Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 413-414, 127 S.Ct. 2618, 168 L.Ed.2d 290 (2007) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (quoting State v. Pendergrass, 19 N.C. 365, 365-366 (1837)); see also Wishy 73. Thus, the quality of teachers and schools had to ""be watched with the most scrupulous attention."" Webster, in Rudolph 64.

For their part, children were expected to be dutiful and obedient. Mintz & Kellogg 53; Wishy 31; cf. J. Kett, Rites of Passage 45 (1977). Schoolbooks instructed children to do so and frequently featured vignettes illustrating the consequences of disobedience. See Adams, ""Pictures of the Vicious ultimately overcome by misery and shame"": The Cultural Work of Early National Schoolbooks (hereinafter Adams), in Marten 156. One oft-related example was the hangings of 19 alleged witches in 1692, which, the schoolbooks noted, likely began with false complaints by two young girls. See J. Morse, The American Geography 191 (1789); see also Adams, in Marten 164.

An entire genre of books, ""loosely termed `advice to youth,'"" taught similar lessons well into the 1800's. J. Demos, Circles and Lines: The Shape of Life in Early America 73 (2004); cf. Wishy 54. ""Next to your duty to God,"" advised one book, ""is your duty to your parents"" even if the child did not ""understand the reason of their commands."" L. Sigourney, The Girl's Reading Book 44 (14th ed. 1843); see also Filial Duty Recommended and Enforced, Introduction, p. iii (c. 1798); The Parent's Present 44 (3d ed. 1841). ""Disobedience is generally punished in some way or other,"" warned another, ""and often very severely."" S. Goodrich, Peter Parley's Book of Fables 43 (1836); see also The Country School-House 27 (1848) (""[T]he number of children who die from the effects of disobedience to their parents is very large"").
4Society's concern with children's development extended to the books they read. ""Vice always spreads by being published,"" Noah Webster observed. Rudolph 62. ""[Y]oung people are taught many vices by fiction, books, or public exhibitions, vices which they never would have known had they never read such books or attended such public places."" Ibid.; see also Cardell, p. xii (cautioning parents that ""[t]he first reading lessons for children have an extensive influence on the acquisitions and habits of future years""); Youth's Companion 1 (""[T]he capacities of children, and the peculiar situation and duties of youth, require select and appropriate reading""). Prominent children's authors harshly criticized  fairy tales and the use of anthropomorphic animals. See, e.g., S. Goodrich, 2 Recollections of a Lifetime 320, n.* (1856) (describing fairy tales as ""calculated to familiarize the mind with things shocking and monstrous; to cultivate a taste for tales of bloodshed and violence; to teach the young to use coarse language, and cherish vulgar ideas; . . . and to fill [the youthful mind] with the horrors of a debased and debauched fancy""); 1 id., at 167 (recalling that children's books were ""full of nonsense"" and ""lies""); Cardell, p. xiv (""The fancy of converting inferior animals into `teachers of children,' has been carried to ridiculous extravagance""); see also MacDonald 83, 103 (noting that fables and works of fantasy were not popular in America in the 1700's).

Adults carefully controlled what they published for children. Stories written for children were dedicated to moral instruction and were relatively austere, lacking details that might titillate children's minds. See MacLeod 24-25, 42-48; see also id., at 42 (""The authors of juvenile fiction imposed the constraints upon themselves in the name of duty, and for the sake of giving children what they thought children should have, although they were often well aware that children might prefer more exciting fare""); Francis, American Children's Literature, 1646-1880, in American Childhood 208-209 (J. Hawes & N. Hiner eds. 1985). John Newbery, the publisher often credited with creating the genre of children's literature, removed traditional folk characters, like Tom Thumb, from their original stories and placed them in new morality tales in which good children were rewarded and disobedient children punished. Reinier 12.

Parents had total authority over what their children read. See A. MacLeod, American Childhood 177 (1994) (""Ideally, if not always actually, nineteenth-century parents regulated their children's lives fully, certainly including their reading""). Lydia Child put it bluntly in The Mother's Book: ""Children . . . should not read anything without a mother's knowledge and sanction; this is particularly necessary between the ages of twelve and sixteen."" Child 92; see also id., at 143 (""[P]arents, or some guardian friends, should carefully examine every volume they put into the hands of young people""); E. Monaghan, Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America 337 (2005) (reviewing a 12-year-old girl's journal from the early 1770's and noting that the child's aunts monitored and guided her reading).
5The law at the time reflected the founding generation's understanding of parent-child relations. According to Sir William Blackstone, parents were responsible for maintaining, protecting, and education their children, and therefore had ""power"" over their children. 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 434, 440 (1765); cf. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 712, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (Blackstone's Commentaries was ""a primary legal authority for 18th- and 19th-century American lawyers""). Chancellor James Kent agreed. 2 Commentaries on American Law *189-*207. The law entitled parents to ""the custody of their [children],"" ""the value of th[e] [children's] labor and services,"" and the ""right to the exercise of such discipline as may be requisite for the discharge of their sacred trust."" Id., at *193, *203. Children, in turn, were charged with ""obedience and assistance during their own minority, and gratitude and reverance during the rest of their lives."" Id., at *207.

Thus, in case after case, courts made clear that parents had a right to the child's labor and services until the child reached majority. In 1810, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts explained, ""There is no question but that a father, who is entitled to the services of his minor son, and for whom he is obliged to provide, may, at the common law, assign those services to others, for a consideration to enure to himself."" Day v. Everett, 7 Mass. 145, 147; see also Benson v. Remington, 2 Mass. 113, 115 (1806) (opinion of Parsons, C.J.) (""The law is very well settled, that parents are under obligations to support their children, and that they are entitled to their earnings""). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Judicature of New Hampshire noted that the right of parents to recover for the services of their child, while a minor, ""cannot be contested."" Gale v. Parrot, 1 N.H. 28, 29 (1817). And parents could bring tort suits against those who knowingly enticed a minor away from them. See, e.g., Kirkpatrick v. Lockhart, 2 Brev. 276, 1809 WL 295 (S.C. Constitutional Ct. 1809); Jones v. Tevis, 14 Ky. 25, 4 Litt. 25 (1823).

Relatedly, boys could not enlist in the military without parental consent. Many of those who did so during the Revolutionary War found, afterwards, that their fathers were entitled to their military wages. See Cox, Boy Soldiers of the American Revolution, in Marten 21-24. And after the war, minors who enlisted without parental consent in violation of federal law could find themselves returned home on writs of habeas corpus issued at their parents' request. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 24 F. Cas. 813 (No. 14,449) (CC Tenn. 1812); Commonwealth v. Callan, 6 Binn. 255 (Pa.1814) (per curiam).

Laws also set age limits restricting marriage without parental consent. For example, from 1730 until at least 1849, Pennsylvania law required parental consent for the marriage of anyone under the age of 21. See 4 Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania 153 (J. Mitchell & H. Flanders eds. 1897) (hereinafter Pa. Stats. at Large); General Laws of Pennsylvania 82-83 (J. Dunlop 2d ed. 1849) (including the 1730 marriage law with no amendments); see also Perpetual Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 253 (1788), in The First Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (J. Cushing ed.1981). In general, ""[p]ost-Revolutionary marriage law assumed that below a certain age, children could . . . no[t] intellectually understand its significance."" Grossberg 105.

Indeed, the law imposed age limits on all manner of activities that required judgment and reason. Children could not vote, could not serve on juries, and generally could not be witnesses in criminal cases unless they were older than 14. See Brewer 43, 145, 148, 159. Nor could they swear loyalty to a State. See, e.g., 9 Pa. Stats. at Large 111 (1903 ed.). Early federal laws granting aliens the ability to become citizens provided that those under 21 were deemed citizens if their fathers chose to naturalize. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 26, 1790, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Jan. 29, 1795, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 415.
CThe history clearly shows a founding generation that believed parents to have complete authority over their minor children and expected parents to direct the development of those children. The Puritan tradition in New England laid the foundation of American parental authority and duty. See MacDonald 6 (""The Puritans are virtually the inventors of the family as we know it today""). In the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, the conception of the child's mind evolved but the duty and authority of parents remained. Indeed, society paid closer attention to potential influences on children than before. See Mintz 72 (""By weakening  earlier forms of patriarchal authority, the Revolution enhanced the importance of childrearing and education in ensuring social stability""). Teachers and schools came under scrutiny, and children's reading material was carefully supervised. Laws reflected these concerns and often supported parental authority with the coercive power of the state.
IIAIn light of this history, the Framers could not possibly have understood ""the freedom of speech"" to include an unqualified right to speak to minors. Specifically, I am sure that the founding generation would not have understood ""the freedom of speech"" to include a right to speak to children without going through their parents. As a consequence, I do not believe that laws limiting such speech—for example, by requiring parental consent to speak to a minor—""abridg[e] the freedom of speech"" within the original meaning of the First Amendment.

We have recently noted that this Court does not have ""freewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment."" Stevens, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1586. But we also recognized that there may be ""some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected [and] have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law."" Ibid. In my opinion, the historical evidence here plainly reveals one such category.[2]
BAdmittedly, the original public understanding of a constitutional provision does not always comport with modern sensibilities. See Morse, 551 U.S., at 419, 127 S.Ct. 2618 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (treating students ""as though it were still the 19th century would find little support today""). It may also be inconsistent with precedent. See McDonald, 561 U.S., at ___-___, 130 S.Ct., at 3084-3086 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (rejecting the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 21 L.Ed. 394 (1873), as inconsistent with the original public meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).

This, however, is not such a case. Although much has changed in this country since the Revolution, the notion that parents have authority over their children and that the law can support that authority persists today. For example, at least some States make it a crime to lure or entice a minor away from the minor's parent. See, e.g., Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 272(b)(1) (West 2008); Fla. Stat.  § 787.03 (2010). Every State in the Union still establishes a minimum age for marriage without parental or judicial consent. Cf. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 558, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (Appendix D to opinion of Court) (2005). Individuals less than 18 years old cannot enlist in the military without parental consent. 10 U.S.C. § 505(a). And minors remain subject to curfew laws across the country, see Brief for Louisiana et al. as Amici Curiae 16, and cannot unilaterally consent to most medical procedures, id., at 15.

Moreover, there are many things minors today cannot do at all, whether they have parental consent or not. State laws set minimum ages for voting and jury duty. See Roper, supra, at 581-585, 125 S.Ct. 1183 (Appendixes B and C to opinion of Court). In California (the State at issue here), minors cannot drive for hire or drive a school bus, Cal. Veh.Code Ann. §§ 12515, 12516 (West 2010), purchase tobacco, Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 308(b) (West 2008), play bingo for money, § 326.5(e), or execute a will, Cal. Probate Code Ann. § 6220 (West 2009).

My understanding of ""the freedom of speech"" is also consistent with this Court's precedents. To be sure, the Court has held that children are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, see, e.g., Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-213, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975), and the government may not unilaterally dictate what children can say or hear, see id., at 213-214, 95 S.Ct. 2268; Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 511, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). But this Court has never held, until today, that ""the freedom of speech"" includes a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents. To the contrary, ""[i]t is well settled that a State or municipality can adopt more stringent controls on communicative materials available to youths than on those available to adults."" Erznoznik, supra, at 212, 95 S.Ct. 2268; cf. post, at 2762-2763 (BREYER, J., dissenting).

The Court's constitutional jurisprudence ""historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children."" Parham v. J. R., 442 U.S. 584, 602, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979). Under that case law, ""legislature[s][can] properly conclude that parents and others, teachers for example, who have . . . primary responsibility for children's well-being are entitled to the support of laws designed to aid discharge of that responsibility."" Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 639, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968); see also Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 635, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979) (opinion of Powell, J.) (""[T]he State is entitled to adjust its legal system to account for children's vulnerability and their needs for concern, . . . sympathy, and. . . paternal attention"" (internal quotation marks omitted)). This is because ""the tradition of parental authority is not inconsistent with our tradition of individual liberty; rather, the former is one of the basic presuppositions of the latter."" Id., at 638, 99 S.Ct. 3035; id., at 638-639, 99 S.Ct. 3035 (""Legal restrictions on minors, especially those supportive of the parental role, may be important to the child's chances for the full growth and maturity that make eventual participation in a free society meaningful and rewarding"").
IIIThe California law at issue here prohibits the sale or rental of ""violent video game[s]"" to minors, defined as anyone ""under 18 years of age."" Cal. Civ.Code Ann. §§ 1746.1(a), 1746 (West 2009). A violation of the law is punishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. § 1746.3. Critically, the law does not prohibit adults from buying or renting violent video games for a minor or prohibit minors from playing such games. Cf. ante, at 2747 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment); post, at 2766-2767 (BREYER, J., dissenting). The law also does not restrict a ""minor's parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian"" from selling or renting him a violent video game. § 1746.1(c).

Respondents, associations of companies in the video game industry, brought a preenforcement challenge to California's law, claiming that on its face the law violates the free speech rights of their members. The Court holds that video games are speech for purposes of the First Amendment and finds the statute facially unconstitutional. See ante, at 2742-2743, 2747-2751. I disagree.

Under any of this Court's standards for a facial First Amendment challenge, this one must fail. The video game associations cannot show ""that no set of circumstances exists under which [the law] would be valid,"" ""that the statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep,"" or that ""a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep."" Stevens, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1587 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even assuming that video games are speech, in most applications the California law does not implicate the First Amendment. All that the law does is prohibit the direct sale or rental of a violent video game to a minor by someone other than the minor's parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian. Where a minor has a parent or guardian, as is usually true, the law does not prevent that minor from obtaining a violent video game with his parent's or guardian's help. In the typical case, the only speech affected is speech that bypasses a minor's parent or guardian. Because such speech does not fall within ""the freedom of speech"" as originally understood, California's law does not ordinarily implicate the First Amendment and is not facially unconstitutional.[3]

* * *

""The freedom of speech,"" as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors without going through the minors' parents or guardians. Therefore, I cannot agree that the statute at issue is facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

I respectfully dissent.
Justice BREYER, dissenting.California imposes a civil fine of up to $1,000 upon any person who distributes a violent video game in California without labeling it ""18,"" or who sells or rents a labeled violent video game to a person under the age of 18. Representatives of the video game and software industries, claiming that the statute violates the First Amendment on its face, seek an injunction against its enforcement. Applying traditional First Amendment analysis, I would uphold the statute as constitutional on its face and would consequently reject the industries' facial challenge.
IACalifornia's statute defines a violent video game as: A game in which a player ""kill[s], maim[s], dismember[s], or sexually assault[s] an image of a human being,""

and
[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors,""and
[the game] is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors,""and
the game, as a whole, ... lack[s] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors."" Cal. Civ.Code Ann. § 1746(d)(1) (West 2009).The statute in effect forbids the sale of such a game to minors unless they are accompanied by a parent; it requires the makers of the game to affix a label identifying it as a game suitable only for those aged 18 and over; it exempts retailers from liability unless such a label is properly affixed to the game; and it imposes a civil fine of up to $1,000 upon a violator. See §§ 1746.1-1746.3.
BA facial challenge to this statute based on the First Amendment can succeed only if ""a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep."" United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 1587, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, it is more difficult to mount a facial First Amendment attack on a statute that seeks to regulate activity that involves action as well as speech. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 614-615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). Hence, I shall focus here upon an area within which I believe the State can legitimately apply its statute, namely sales to minors under the age of 17 (the age cutoff used by the industry's own ratings system), of highly realistic violent video games, which a reasonable game maker would know meet the Act's criteria. That area lies at the heart of the statute. I shall assume that the number of instances in which the State will enforce the statute within that area is comparatively large, and that the number outside that area (for example, sales to 17-year-olds) is comparatively small. And the activity the statute regulates combines speech with action (a virtual form of target practice).
CIn determining whether the statute is unconstitutional, I would apply both this Court's ""vagueness"" precedents and a strict form of First Amendment scrutiny. In doing so, the special First Amendment category I find relevant is not (as the Court claims) the category of ""depictions of violence,"" ante, at 2736, but rather the category of ""protection of children."" This Court has held that the ""power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults."" Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 170, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944). And the ""`regulatio[n] of communication addressed to [children] need not conform to the requirements of the [F]irst [A]mendment in the same way as those applicable to adults.'"" Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638, n. 6, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968) (quoting Emerson, Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment, 72 Yale L.J. 877, 939 (1963)).

The majority's claim that the California statute, if upheld, would create a ""new categor[y] of unprotected speech,"" ante, at 2734, 2735, is overstated. No one here argues that depictions of violence, even extreme violence, automatically fall outside the First Amendment's protective scope as, for example, do obscenity and  depictions of child pornography. We properly speak of categories of expression that lack protection when, like ""child pornography,"" the category is broad, when it applies automatically, and when the State can prohibit everyone, including adults, from obtaining access to the material within it. But where, as here, careful analysis must precede a narrower judicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout of ""fire"" in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terrorist group how to peacefully petition the United Nations), we do not normally describe the result as creating a ""new category of unprotected speech."" See Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2705, 177 L.Ed.2d 355 (2010).

Thus, in Stevens, after rejecting the claim that all depictions of animal cruelty (a category) fall outside the First Amendment's protective scope, we went on to decide whether the particular statute at issue violates the First Amendment under traditional standards; and we held that, because the statute was overly broad, it was invalid. Similarly, here the issue is whether, applying traditional First Amendment standards, this statute does, or does not, pass muster.
IIIn my view, California's statute provides ""fair notice of what is prohibited,"" and consequently it is not impermissibly vague. United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008). Ginsberg explains why that is so. The Court there considered a New York law that forbade the sale to minors of a
picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion picture film, or similar visual representation or image of a person or portion of the human body which depicts nudity ...,""that
predominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors,""and
is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors,""and
is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors."" 390 U.S., at 646-647, 88 S.Ct. 1274.This Court upheld the New York statute in Ginsberg (which is sometimes unfortunately confused with a very different, earlier case, Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 942, 16 L.Ed.2d 31 (1966)). The five-Justice majority, in an opinion written by Justice Brennan, wrote that the statute was sufficiently clear. 390 U.S., at 643-645, 88 S.Ct. 1274. No Member of the Court voiced any vagueness objection. See id., at 648-650, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Stewart, J., concurring in result); id., at 650-671, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Douglas, J., joined by Black, J., dissenting); id., at 671-675, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Fortas, J., dissenting).

Comparing the language of California's statute (set forth supra, at 2732-2733) with the language of New York's statute (set forth immediately above), it is difficult to find any vagueness-related difference. Why are the words ""kill,"" ""maim,"" and ""dismember"" any more difficult to understand than the word ""nudity?"" Justice ALITO objects that these words do ""not perform the narrowing function"" that this Court has required in adult obscenity cases, where statutes can only cover ""`hard core'"" depictions. Ante, at 2744-2745 (opinion concurring in judgment). But the relevant comparison is not to adult obscenity cases but to Ginsberg, which dealt with ""nudity,"" a category no more ""narrow"" than killing and maiming. And in any event, narrowness and vagueness do not necessarily have anything to do with one another. All that is required for vagueness purposes is that the terms ""kill,"" ""maim,"" and ""dismember"" give fair notice as to what they cover, which they do.

The remainder of California's definition copies, almost word for word, the language this Court used in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), in permitting a total ban on material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with criminal penalties). The California law's reliance on ""community standards"" adheres to Miller, and in Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 916, 103 L.Ed.2d 34 (1989), this Court specifically upheld the use of Miller' s language against charges of vagueness. California only departed from the Miller formulation in two significant respects: It substituted the word ""deviant"" for the words ""prurient"" and ""shameful,"" and it three times added the words ""for minors."" The word ""deviant"" differs from ""prurient"" and ""shameful,"" but it would seem no less suited to defining and narrowing the reach of the statute. And the addition of ""for minors"" to a version of the Miller standard was approved in Ginsberg, 390 U.S., at 643, 88 S.Ct. 1274, even though the New York law ""dr[ew] no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority,"" ante, at 2746 (opinion of ALITO, J.).

Both the Miller standard and the law upheld in Ginsberg lack perfect clarity. But that fact reflects the difficulty of the Court's long search for words capable of protecting expression without depriving the State of a legitimate constitutional power to regulate. As is well known, at one point Justice Stewart thought he could do no better in defining obscenity than, ""I know it when I see it."" Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (concurring opinion). And Justice Douglas dissented from Miller's standard, which he thought was still too vague. 413 U.S., at 39-40, 93 S.Ct. 2607. Ultimately, however, this Court accepted the ""community standards"" tests used in Miller and Ginsberg. They reflect the fact that sometimes, even when a precise standard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify instances that fall within a legitimate regulation. And they seek to draw a line, which, while favoring free expression, will nonetheless permit a legislature to find the words necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional objective. Cf. Williams, supra, at 304, 128 S.Ct. 1830 (the Constitution does not always require ""`perfect clarity and precise guidance,'"" even when ""`expressive activity'"" is involved).

What, then, is the difference between Ginsberg and Miller on the one hand and the California law on the other? It will often be easy to pick out cases at which California's statute directly aims, involving, say, a character who shoots out a police officer's knee, douses him with gasoline, lights him on fire, urinates on his burning body, and finally kills him with a gunshot to the head. (Footage of one such game sequence has been submitted in the record.) See also ante, at 2749-2750 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). As in Miller and Ginsberg, the California law clearly protects even the most violent games that possess serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. § 1746(d)(1)(A)(iii). And it is easier here than in Miller or Ginsberg to separate the sheep from the goats at the statute's border. That is because here the industry itself has promulgated standards and created a review process, in which adults who ""typically have experience with children"" assess what games are inappropriate for minors. See Entertainment Software Rating Board, Rating Process, online at http:// www.esrb.org/ratings/ & ratings_ process.jsp (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).

There is, of course, one obvious difference: The Ginsberg statute concerned depictions of ""nudity,"" while California's statute concerns extremely violent video games. But for purposes of vagueness, why should that matter? Justice ALITO argues that the Miller standard sufficed because there are ""certain generally accepted norms concerning expression related to sex,"" whereas there are no similarly ""accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment."" Ante, at 2745. But there is no evidence that is so. The Court relied on ""community standards"" in Miller precisely because of the difficulty of articulating ""accepted norms"" about depictions of sex. I can find no difference—historical or otherwise—that is relevant to the vagueness question. Indeed, the majority's examples of literary descriptions of violence, on which Justice ALITO relies, do not show anything relevant at all.

After all, one can find in literature as many (if not more) descriptions of physical love as descriptions of violence. Indeed, sex ""has been a theme in art and literature throughout the ages."" Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 246, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002). For every Homer, there is a Titian. For every Dante, there is an Ovid. And for all the teenagers who have read the original versions of Grimm's Fairy Tales, I suspect there are those who know the story of Lady Godiva.

Thus, I can find no meaningful vagueness-related differences between California's law and the New York law upheld in Ginsberg. And if there remain any vagueness problems, the state courts can cure them through interpretation. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975) (""[S]tate statute should not be deemed facially invalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts""). Cf. Ginsberg, supra, at 644, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (relying on the fact that New York Court of Appeals would read a knowledge requirement into the statute); Berry v. Santa Barbara, 40 Cal.App.4th 1075, 1088-1089, 47 Cal.Rptr.2d 661, 669 (1995) (reading a knowledge requirement into a statute). Consequently, for purposes of this facial challenge, I would not find the statute unconstitutionally vague.
IIIVideo games combine physical action with expression. Were physical activity to predominate in a game, government could appropriately intervene, say by requiring parents to accompany children when playing a game involving actual target practice, or restricting the sale of toys presenting physical dangers to children. See generally Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, 122 Stat. 3016 (""Title I— Children's Product Safety""). But because video games also embody important expressive and artistic elements, I agree with the Court that the First Amendment significantly limits the State's power to regulate. And I would determine whether the State has exceeded those limits by applying a strict standard of review.

Like the majority, I believe that the California law must be ""narrowly tailored"" to further a ""compelling interest,"" without there being a ""less restrictive"" alternative that would be ""at least as effective."" Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 874, 875, 879, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). I would not apply this strict standard ""mechanically."" United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 841, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000) (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and SCALIA, JJ., dissenting). Rather, in applying it, I would evaluate the degree to which the statute injures speech-related interests, the nature of the potentially-justifying ""compelling interests,"" the degree to which the statute furthers that interest, the nature and effectiveness of possible alternatives, and, in light of this evaluation, whether, overall, ""the statute works speech-related harm ... out of proportion to the benefits that the statute seeks to provide."" Ibid. See also Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 210, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992) (plurality opinion) (applying strict scrutiny and finding relevant the lack of a ""significant impingement"" on speech).

First Amendment standards applied in this way are difficult but not impossible to satisfy. Applying ""strict scrutiny"" the Court has upheld restrictions on speech that, for example, ban the teaching of peaceful dispute resolution to a group on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations, Holder, 561 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2723-3730; but cf. id., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2731 (BREYER, J., dissenting), and limit speech near polling places, Burson, supra, at 210-211, 112 S.Ct. 1846 (plurality opinion). And applying less clearly defined but still rigorous standards, the Court has allowed States to require disclosure of petition signers, Doe v. Reed, 561 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2811, 177 L.Ed.2d 493 (2010), and to impose campaign contribution limits that were ""`closely drawn' to match a `sufficiently important interest,'"" Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 387-388, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000).

Moreover, although the Court did not specify the ""level of scrutiny"" it applied in Ginsberg, we have subsequently described that case as finding a ""compelling interest"" in protecting children from harm sufficient to justify limitations on speech. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989). Since the Court in Ginsberg specified that the statute's prohibition applied to material that was not obscene, 390 U.S., at 634, 88 S.Ct. 1274, I cannot dismiss Ginsberg on the ground that it concerned obscenity. But cf. ante, at 2735 (majority opinion). Nor need I depend upon the fact that the Court in Ginsberg insisted only that the legislature have a ""rational"" basis for finding the depictions there at issue harmful to children. 390 U.S., at 639, 88 S.Ct. 1274. For in this case, California has substantiated its claim of harm with considerably stronger evidence.
ACalifornia's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression. The statute prevents no one from playing a video game, it prevents no adult from buying a video game, and it prevents no child or adolescent from obtaining a game provided a parent is willing to help. § 1746.1(c). All it prevents is a child or adolescent from buying, without a parent's assistance, a gruesomely violent video game of a kind that the industry itself tells us it wants to keep out of the hands of those under the age of 17. See Brief for Respondents 8.

Nor is the statute, if upheld, likely to create a precedent that would adversely affect other media, say films, or videos, or books. A typical video game involves a significant amount of physical activity. See ante, at 2748-2749 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (citing examples of the increasing interactivity of video game controllers). And pushing buttons that achieve an interactive, virtual form of target practice (using images of human beings as targets), while containing an expressive component, is not just like watching a typical movie. See infra, at 2768-2769.
BThe interest that California advances in support of the statute is compelling. As this Court has previously described that interest, it consists of both (1) the ""basic"" parental claim ""to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children,"" which makes it proper to enact ""laws designed to aid discharge of [parental] responsibility,"" and (2) the State's ""independent interest in the well-being of its youth."" Ginsberg, 390 U.S., at 639-640, 88 S.Ct. 1274. Cf. id., at 639, n. 7, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (""`[O]ne can well distinguish laws which do not impose a morality on children, but which support the right of parents to deal with the morals of their children as they see fit'"" (quoting Henkin, Morals and the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum. L.Rev. 391, 413, n. 68 (1963))). And where these interests work in tandem, it is not fatally ""underinclusive"" for a State to advance its interests in protecting children against the special harms present in an interactive video game medium through a default rule that still allows parents to provide their children with what their parents wish.

Both interests are present here. As to the need to help parents guide their children, the Court noted in 1968 that ""`parental control or guidance cannot always be provided.'"" 390 U.S., at 640, 88 S.Ct. 1274. Today, 5.3 million grade-school-age children of working parents are routinely home alone. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Who's Minding the Kids? Child Care Arrangements: Spring 2005/Summer 2006, p. 12 (2010), online at http:// www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p70-121.pdf. Thus, it has, if anything, become more important to supplement parents' authority to guide their children's development.

As to the State's independent interest, we have pointed out that juveniles are more likely to show a ""`lack of maturity'"" and are ""more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,"" and that their ""character ... is not as well formed as that of an adult."" Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569-570, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). And we have therefore recognized ""a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors."" Sable Communications, supra, at 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829.

At the same time, there is considerable evidence that California's statute significantly furthers this compelling interest. That is, in part, because video games are excellent teaching tools. Learning a practical task often means developing habits, becoming accustomed to performing the task, and receiving positive reinforcement when performing that task well. Video games can help develop habits, accustom the player to performance of the task, and reward the player for performing that task well. Why else would the Armed Forces incorporate video games into its training? See CNN, War Games: Military Training Goes High-Tech (Nov. 22, 2001), online at http://articles.cnn.com / 2001-11-2 / tech /2war.games_1_ictbill-swartout-real-world-training?_s=PM:TECH.

When the military uses video games to help soldiers train for missions, it is using this medium for a beneficial purpose. But California argues that when the teaching features of video games are put to less desirable ends, harm can ensue. In particular, extremely violent games can harm children by rewarding them for being violently aggressive in play, and thereby often teaching them to be violently aggressive in life. And video games can cause more harm in this respect than can typically passive media, such as books or films or television programs.

There are many scientific studies that support California's views. Social scientists, for example, have found causal evidence that playing these games results in harm. Longitudinal studies, which measure changes over time, have found that increased exposure to violent video games causes an increase in aggression over the same period. See Möller & Krahe, Exposure to Violent Video Games and Aggression in German Adolescents: A Longitudinal Analysis, 35 Aggressive Behavior 75 (2009); Gentile & Gentile, Violent Video Games as Exemplary Teachers: A Conceptual Analysis, 37 J. Youth & Adolescence 127 (2008); Anderson et al., Longitudinal Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggression in Japan and the United States, 122 Pediatrics e1067 (2008); Wallenius & Punamuki, Digital Game Violence and Direct Aggression in Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study of the Roles of Sex, Age, and Parent-Child Communication, 29 J. Applied Developmental Psychology 286 (2008).

Experimental studies in laboratories have found that subjects randomly assigned to play a violent video game subsequently displayed more characteristics of aggression than those who played nonviolent games. See, e.g., Anderson et al., Violent Video Games: Specific Effects of Violent Content on Aggressive Thoughts and Behavior, 36 Advances in Experimental Soc. Psychology 199 (2004).

Surveys of 8th and 9th grade students have found a correlation between playing violent video games and aggression. See, e.g., Gentile, Lynch, Linder, & Walsh, The Effects of Violent Video Game Habits On Adolescent Hostility, Aggressive Behaviors, and School Performance, 27 J. Adolescence 5 (2004).

Cutting-edge neuroscience has shown that ""virtual violence in video game playing results in those neural patterns that are considered characteristic for aggressive cognition and behavior."" Weber, Ritterfeld, & Mathiak, Does Playing Violent Video Games Induce Aggression? Empirical Evidence of a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study, 8 Media Psychology 39, 51 (2006).

And ""meta-analyses,"" i.e., studies of all the studies, have concluded that exposure to violent video games ""was positively associated with aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect,"" and that ""playing violent video games is a causal risk factor for long-term harmful outcomes."" Anderson et al., Violent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy, and Prosocial Behavior in Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review, 136 Psychological Bulletin 151, 167, 169 (2010) (emphasis added).

Some of these studies take care to explain in a commonsense way why video games are potentially more harmful than, say, films or books or television. In essence, they say that the closer a child's behavior comes, not to watching, but to acting out horrific violence, the greater the potential psychological harm. See Bushman & Huesmann, Aggression, in 2 Handbook of Social Pscyhology 833, 851 (S. Fiske, D. Gilbert, & G. Lindzey eds., 5th ed.2010) (video games stimulate more aggression because ""[p]eople learn better when they are actively involved,"" players are ""more likely to identify with violent characters,"" and ""violent games directly reward violent behavior""); Polman, de Castro, & van Aken, Experimental Study of the Differential Effects of Playing Versus Watching Violent Video Games on Children's Aggressive Behavior, 34 Aggressive Behavior 256 (2008) (finding greater aggression resulting from playing, as opposed to watching, a violent game); C. Anderson, D. Gentile, & K. Buckley, Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adolescents 136-137 (2007) (three studies finding greater effects from games as opposed to television). See also infra, at 2769-2770 (statements of expert public health associations agreeing that interactive games can be more harmful than ""passive"" media like television); ante, at 2748-2751 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment).

Experts debate the conclusions of all these studies. Like many, perhaps most, studies of human behavior, each study has its critics, and some of those critics have produced studies of their own in which they reach different conclusions. (I list both sets of research in the appendixes.) I, like most judges, lack the social science expertise to say definitively who is right. But associations of public health professionals who do possess that expertise have reviewed many of these studies and found a significant risk that violent video games, when compared with more passive media, are particularly likely to cause children harm.

Eleven years ago, for example, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Psychiatric Association released a joint statement, which said:
[O]ver 1000 studies ... point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children ... [and, though less research had been done at that time, preliminary studies indicated that] the impact of violent interactive entertainment (video games and other interactive media) on young people ... may be significantly more severe than that wrought by television, movies, or music."" Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment Violence on Children (2000) (emphasis added), online at http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm.Five years later, after more research had been done, the American Psychological Association adopted a resolution that said:
[C]omprehensive analysis of violent interactive video game research suggests such exposure ... increases aggressive behavior, ... increases aggressive thoughts, ... increases angry feelings,... decreases helpful behavior, and ... increases physiological arousal."" Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media (2005), online at http://ww.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/interactive-media.pdf.The Association added:
[T]he practice, repetition, and rewards for acts of violence may be more conducive to increasing aggressive behavior among children and youth than passively watching violence on TV and in films."" Ibid. (emphasis added).Four years after that, in 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement in significant part about interactive media. It said:
Studies of these rapidly growing and ever-more-sophisticated types of media have indicated that the effects of child-initiated virtual violence may be even more profound than those of passive media such as television. In many games the child or teenager is `embedded' in the game and uses a `joystick' (handheld controller) that enhances both the experience and the aggressive feelings."" Policy Statement—Media Violence, 124 Pediatrics 1495, 1498 (2009) (emphasis added).It added:
Correlational and experimental studies have revealed that violent video games lead to increases in aggressive behavior and aggressive thinking and decreases in prosocial behavior. Recent longitudinal studies ... have revealed that in as little as 3 months, high exposure to violent video games increased physical aggression. Other recent longitudinal studies ... have revealed similar effects across 2 years."" Ibid. (footnotes omitted).Unlike the majority, I would find sufficient grounds in these studies and expert opinions for this Court to defer to an elected legislature's conclusion that the video games in question are particularly likely to harm children. This Court has always thought it owed an elected legislature some degree of deference in respect to legislative facts of this kind, particularly when they involve technical matters that are beyond our competence, and even in First Amendment cases. See Holder, 561 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2726-2727 (deferring, while applying strict scrutiny, to the Government's national security judgments); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. 180, 195-196, 117 S.Ct. 1174, 137 L.Ed.2d 369 (1997) (deferring, while applying intermediate scrutiny, to the Government's technological judgments). The majority, in reaching its own, opposite conclusion about the validity of the relevant studies, grants the legislature no deference at all. Compare ante, at 2738-2739 (stating that the studies do not provide evidence that violent video games ""cause"" harm (emphasis deleted)), with supra, at 2767-2768 (citing longitudinal studies finding causation).
CI can find no ""less restrictive"" alternative to California's law that would be ""at least as effective."" See Reno, 521 U.S., at 874, 117 S.Ct. 2329. The majority points to a voluntary alternative: The industry tries to prevent those under 17 from buying extremely violent games by labeling those games with an ""M"" (Mature) and encouraging retailers to restrict their sales to those 17 and older. See ante, at 2740-2741. But this voluntary system has serious enforcement gaps. When California enacted its law, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study had found that nearly 70% of unaccompanied 13- to 16-year-olds were able to buy M-rated video games. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 27 (2004), online at http://www. ftc.gov/os/2004/ 07/040708kidsviolencerpt. pdf. Subsequently the voluntary program has become more effective. But as of the FTC's most recent update to Congress, 20% of those under 17 are still able to buy M-rated video games, and, breaking down sales by store, one finds that this number rises to nearly 50% in the case of one large national chain. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 28 (2009), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/12/ P994511violententertainment.pdf. And the industry could easily revert back to the substantial noncompliance that existed in 2004, particularly after today's broad ruling reduces the industry's incentive to police itself.


IVThe upshot is that California's statute, as applied to its heartland of applications (i.e., buyers under 17; extremely violent, realistic video games), imposes a restriction on speech that is modest at most. That restriction is justified by a compelling interest (supplementing parents' efforts to prevent their children from purchasing potentially harmful violent, interactive material). And there is no equally effective, less restrictive alternative. California's statute is consequently constitutional on its face—though litigants remain free to challenge the statute as applied in particular instances, including any effort by the State to apply it to minors aged 17.

I add that the majority's different conclusion creates a serious anomaly in First Amendment law. Ginsberg makes clear that a State can prohibit the sale to minors of depictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a State cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most violent interactive video games. But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13-year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her? What kind of First Amendment would permit the government to protect children by restricting sales of that extremely violent video game only when the woman—bound, gagged, tortured, and killed—is also topless?

This anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment. It disappears once one recognizes that extreme violence, where interactive, and without literary, artistic, or similar justification, can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to children as photographs of nudity. And the record here is more than adequate to support such a view. That is why I believe that Ginsberg controls the outcome here a fortiori. And it is why I believe California's law is constitutional on its face.

This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education. Our Constitution cannot succeed in securing the liberties it seeks to protect unless we can raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work. Education, however, is about choices. Sometimes, children need to learn by making choices for themselves. Other times, choices are made for children—by their parents, by their teachers, and by the people acting democratically through their governments. In my view, the First Amendment does not disable government from helping parents make such a choice here—a choice not to have their children buy extremely violent, interactive video games, which they more than reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those children.

For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.
FOOTNOTES[1] Justice ALITO distinguishes Stevens on several grounds that seem to us ill founded. He suggests, post, at 2747 (opinion concurring in judgment), that Stevens did not apply strict scrutiny. If that is so (and we doubt it), it would make this an a fortiori case. He says, post, at 2746-2747, 2747, that the California Act punishes the sale or rental rather than the ""creation"" or ""possession"" of violent depictions. That distinction appears nowhere in Stevens itself, and for good reason: It would make permissible the prohibition of printing or selling books—though not the writing of them. Whether government regulation applies to creating, distributing, or consuming speech makes no difference. And finally, Justice ALITO points out, post, at 2747, that Stevens ""left open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute"" would be constitutional. True, but entirely irrelevant. Stevens said, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1592, that the ""crush-video"" statute at issue there might pass muster if it were limited to videos of acts of animal cruelty that violated the law where the acts were performed. There is no contention that any of the virtual characters depicted in the imaginative videos at issue here are criminally liable.

[2] The statute in Ginsberg restricted the sale of certain depictions of ""nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-masochistic abuse,"" that were ""`[h]armful to minors.'"" A depiction was harmful to minors if it:

""(i) predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interests of minors, and

""(ii) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors, and

""(iii) is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors."" 390 U.S., at 646, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court) (quoting N.Y. Penal Law § 484-h(1)(f)).

[3] Justice THOMAS ignores the holding of Erznoznik, and denies that persons under 18 have any constitutional right to speak or be spoken to without their parents' consent. He cites no case, state or federal, supporting this view, and to our knowledge there is none. Most of his dissent is devoted to the proposition that parents have traditionally had the power to control what their children hear and say. This is true enough. And it perhaps follows from this that the state has the power to enforce parental prohibitions—to require, for example, that the promoters of a rock concert exclude those minors whose parents have advised the promoters that their children are forbidden to attend. But it does not follow that the state has the power to prevent children from hearing or saying anything without their parents' prior consent. The latter would mean, for example, that it could be made criminal to admit persons under 18 to a political rally without their parents' prior written consent—even a political rally in support of laws against corporal punishment of children, or laws in favor of greater rights for minors. And what is good for First Amendment rights of speech must be good for First Amendment rights of religion as well: It could be made criminal to admit a person under 18 to church, or to give a person under 18 a religious tract, without his parents' prior consent. Our point is not, as Justice THOMAS believes, post, at 2759, n. 2, merely that such laws are ""undesirable."" They are obviously an infringement upon the religious freedom of young people and those who wish to proselytize young people. Such laws do not enforce parental authority over children's speech and religion; they impose governmental authority, subject only to a parental veto. In the absence of any precedent for state control, uninvited by the parents, over a child's speech and religion (Justice THOMAS cites none), and in the absence of any justification for such control that would satisfy strict scrutiny, those laws must be unconstitutional. This argument is not, as Justice THOMAS asserts, ""circular,"" ibid. It is the absence of any historical warrant or compelling justification for such restrictions, not our ipse dixit, that renders them invalid.

[4] Justice ALITO accuses us of pronouncing that playing violent video games ""is not different in `kind'"" from reading violent literature. Post, at 2742. Well of course it is different in kind, but not in a way that causes the provision and viewing of violent video games, unlike the provision and reading of books, not to be expressive activity and hence not to enjoy First Amendment protection. Reading Dante is unquestionably more cultured and intellectually edifying than playing Mortal Kombat. But these cultural and intellectual differences are not constitutional ones. Crudely violent video games, tawdry TV shows, and cheap novels and magazines are no less forms of speech than The Divine Comedy, and restrictions upon them must survive strict scrutiny—a question to which we devote our attention in Part III, infra. Even if we can see in them ""nothing of any possible value to society . . ., they are as much entitled to the protection of free speech as the best of literature."" Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 510, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840 (1948).

[5] The crusade against comic books was led by a psychiatrist, Frederic Wertham, who told the Senate Judiciary Committee that ""as long as the crime comic books industry exists in its present forms there are no secure homes."" Juvenile Delinquency (Comic Books): Hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 84 (1954). Wertham's objections extended even to Superman comics, which he described as ""particularly injurious to the ethical development of children."" Id., at 86. Wertham's crusade did convince the New York Legislature to pass a ban on the sale of certain comic books to minors, but it was vetoed by Governor Thomas Dewey on the ground that it was unconstitutional given our opinion in Winters, supra. See People v. Bookcase, Inc., 14 N.Y.2d 409, 412-413, 252 N.Y.S.2d 433, 201 N.E.2d 14, 15-16 (1964).

Granholm, 426 F.Supp.2d 646, 653 (E.D.Mich. 2006); Entertainment Software Assn. v. Blagojevich, 404 F.Supp.2d 1051, 1063 (N.D.Ill. 2005), aff'd, 469 F.3d 641 (C.A.7 2006).

[7] One study, for example, found that children who had just finished playing violent video games were more likely to fill in the blank letter in ""explo_e"" with a ""d"" (so that it reads ""explode"") than with an ""r"" (""explore""). App. 496, 506 (internal quotation marks omitted). The prevention of this phenomenon, which might have been anticipated with common sense, is not a compelling state interest.

[8] Justice ALITO is mistaken in thinking that we fail to take account of ""new and rapidly evolving technology,"" post, at 2742. The studies in question pertain to that new and rapidly evolving technology, and fail to show, with the degree of certitude that strict scrutiny requires, that this subject-matter restriction on speech is justified. Nor is Justice ALITO correct in attributing to us the view that ""violent video games really present no serious problem."" Post, at 2742. Perhaps they do present a problem, and perhaps none of us would allow our own children to play them. But there are all sorts of ""problems""—some of them surely more serious than this one— that cannot be addressed by governmental restriction of free expression: for example, the problem of encouraging anti-Semitism (National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43, 97 S.Ct. 2205, 53 L.Ed.2d 96 (1977) (per curiam)), the problem of spreading a political philosophy hostile to the Constitution (Noto v. United States, 367 U.S. 290, 81 S.Ct. 1517, 6 L.Ed.2d 836 (1961)), or the problem of encouraging disrespect for the Nation's flag (Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989)).

Justice BREYER would hold that California has satisfied strict scrutiny based upon his own research into the issue of the harmfulness of violent video games. See post, at 2771-2779 (Appendixes to dissenting opinion) (listing competing academic articles discussing the harmfulness vel non of violent video games). The vast preponderance of this research is outside the record—and in any event we do not see how it could lead to Justice BREYER's conclusion, since he admits he cannot say whether the studies on his side are right or wrong. Post, at 2769. Similarly, Justice ALITO says he is not ""sure"" whether there are any constitutionally dispositive differences between video games and other media. Post, at 2742-2743. If that is so, then strict scrutiny plainly has not been satisfied.

[9] Justice BREYER concludes that the remaining gap is compelling because, according to the FTC's report, some ""20% of those under 17 are still able to buy M-rated games."" Post, at 2770 (citing FTC Report 28). But some gap in compliance is unavoidable. The sale of alcohol to minors, for example, has long been illegal, but a 2005 study suggests that about 18% of retailers still sell alcohol to those under the drinking age. Brief for State of Rhode Island et al. as Amici Curiae 18. Even if the sale of violent video games to minors could be deterred further by increasing regulation, the government does not have a compelling interest in each marginal percentage point by which its goals are advanced.
ALITO CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES[1] It is well established that a judgment may be affirmed on an alternative ground that was properly raised but not addressed by the lower court. Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 478, n. 20, 99 S.Ct. 740, 58 L.Ed.2d 740 (1979).

[2] Under the California law, a game that meets the threshold requirement set out in text also qualifies as ""violent"" if it ""[e]nables the player to virtually inflict serious injury upon images of human beings or characters with substantially human characteristics in a manner which is especially heinous, cruel, or depraved in that it involves torture or serious physical abuse to the victim."" § 1746(d)(1)(B). In the Court of Appeals, California conceded that this alternative definition is unconstitutional, 556 F.3d 950, 954, n. 5 (C.A.9 2009), and therefore only the requirements set out in text are now before us.

[3] The provision of New York law under which the petitioner was convicted in Ginsberg was framed with similar specificity. This provision applied to depictions of ""nudity"" and ""sexual conduct,"" and both those terms were specifically and unambiguously defined. See 390 U.S., at 645-647, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court).

[4] The California law does not define the term ""maiming,"" nor has the State cited any decisions from its courts that define the term in this context. Accordingly, I take the term to have its ordinary meaning, which includes the infliction of any serious wound, see Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1362 (2002) (hereinafter Webster's).

[5] At oral argument, California also proposed that the term ""minors"" could be interpreted as referring to the ""typical age group of minors"" who play video games. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But nothing in the law's text supports such a limitation. Nor has California cited any decisions indicating that its courts would restrict the law in this way. And there is nothing in the record indicating what this age group might be.

[19] As the Court notes, there are a few children's books that ask young readers to step into the shoes of a character and to make choices that take the stories along one of a very limited number of possible lines. See ante, at 2737-2738. But the very nature of the print medium makes it impossible for a book to offer anything like the same number of choices as those provided by a video game.
THOMAS DISSENT FOOTNOTES[1] Justice ALITO concludes that the law is too vague to satisfy due process, but neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed that question. Ante, at 2742-2747 (opinion concurring in judgment). As we have often said, this Court is ""one of final review, `not of first view.'"" FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1800, 1819, 173 L.Ed.2d 738 (2009) (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718, n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005)).

[2] The majority responds that ""it does not follow"" from the historical evidence ""that the state has the power to prevent children from hearing . . . anything without their parents' prior consent."" Ante, at 2736, n. 3. Such a conclusion, the majority asserts, would lead to laws that, in its view, would be undesirable and ""obviously"" unconstitutional. Ibid.

The majority's circular argument misses the point. The question is not whether certain laws might make sense to judges or legislators today, but rather what the public likely understood ""the freedom of speech"" to mean when the First Amendment was adopted. See District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 634-635, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008). I believe it is clear that the founding public would not have understood ""the freedom of speech"" to include speech to minor children bypassing their parents. It follows that the First Amendment imposes no restriction on state regulation of such speech. To note that there may not be ""precedent for [such] state control,"" ante, at 2736, n. 3, ""is not to establish that [there] is a constitutional right,"" McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 373, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).

[3] Whether the statute would survive an as-applied challenge in the unusual case of an emancipated minor is a question for another day. To decide this case, it is enough that the statute is not unconstitutional on its face.",186853,2,0.811,0.507,0.312,0,0.122,-5.751,0.028,141.819,0.466

[Verso 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ayer recibí una llamada de mi amigo como a las 1:01 AM
Dijo que mataron a su único hijo por fondos insuficientes
Él estaba llorando, estaba molesto de manera agresiva y borracho
Hablando en su cabeza, filosofando de porque el Señor lo había hecho
Él dijo: ""K-Dot, ¿puedes orar por mí?
Ha sido un día jodido para mí
Sé que estás bendecido, enséñame cómo superarlo.""
Él estaba buscando aceptarlo
Esperando que pudiera acercarlo más
A lo espiritual, mi espíritu no lo hace mejor, pero le dije
""No puedo endulzarte la respuesta, esto es como me siento:
Si alguien mata a mi hijo, eso significa
Que alguien será asesinado.""
Dime lo que haces por amor, lealtad y pasión de
Todos los recuerdos recogidos, momentos de los que nunca podrías regresar
Voy a esperar en frente del lugar de los negros y verlo andar en su bloque
Voy a agarrar a un negro dejando el servicio si eso es todo lo que tengo
Mataré a un negro, luego tiraré el arma en su regazo
Camino hacia la corte como ""Perra, ¡yo hice eso!""
No hay poder negro cuando tu bebé muere por un cobarde
Ni siquiera puedo mantener la paz, no jodas con ningunos de los nuestros
Será asesinato en la calle, serán cuerpos a la hora
Un helicóptero estará en la calle, paramédicos en la línea
Deja que alguien toque a mi mamá
Toque a mi hermana, toque a mi mujer
Toque a mi papá, toque a mi sobrina
Toque a mi sobrino, toque a mi hermano
Deberías matar a un negro luego tirar el arma en su regazo
De hecho, estoy a punto de hablar en esta convención
Te llamaré—

You know I'm back like I never left
Another sprint, another step
Another day, another breath
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept
I got a new attitude and a lease on life
And some peace of mind
Seek and I find I can sleep when I die
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight
I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?
Legend it's exodus searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo!

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in
Since we hopped out that Delorean (Delorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things
They don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like woo, that boy got bars

I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you

Honestly, this party's over
Everyone here shoulda gone home
But I'm afraid of being sober
'Cause the first thing I do when I'm alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I start touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
So I squeeze out the lime on the ice of my drink
And the juice hits the cuts on my fingers
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

[Chorus]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But somethings you can't undo
And one of them's you

[Verse 2]
I'm afraid to turn the lights on
I don't want to face this rebound
Is it weird if I come over?
I want to, but I know that she's around

I should have deleted, but kept it a secret

Been through every emotion
Right now, I'm sad and broken
Like the bottles on the floor, but I'm too buzzed to clean 'em up

So I could, I could un-love you

They never knew my struggle
Rose above the rubble
Rather live inside they bubble
Than go through the trouble
Of having they double-double vision corrected
They just neglect it and—
I've been thinkin' lately
Will the Devil take me?
Or will God protect me?
I know I ain't perfect, but you should respect me
They don't want me happy
They don't want to let me live

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

I am me
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
But understand, aren't we all?
So when it comes to passin' judgements
I don't think that you're the one to make the call
Heaven want to cast me out for being me
I know there's others like me that'll break the fall
I know you hater motherfuckers just can't relate at all

33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top

Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, ""What up, Killa?""
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, ""Man, why him?""
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know

They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur

I just looked in the mirror like, ""Alright, alright, alright""
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana

Es difícil abrir mis ojos y ya no verte
Tu olor en la cama aún sigue intacto (oh-oh-oh)
Te he buscado en mis sueños deseándo tenerte
Y no encuentro tu rostro por más que trato

[Pre-Coro: Reik]
Aún quedan tus retratos
En cada rincón de la casa
Y el silencio me habla de ti
Es que sobra tanto espacio
Desde que no estás (oh-oh)
Daría todo lo que hoy me queda por tenerte
Por que vuelvas

No puedo asimilar
Que ya tú no estás, sin ti nada es igual
Sé que por el mundo no hay otra similar
¿Qué tú me hiciste que no te puedo olvidar?
Ay 'ombe, tú me quiere' a tu manera (pah-pah)
Mi mente quisiera que otra me quisiera (pah)
Mi corazón dice que por ti espera
Que porque volviera' daría lo que fuera (yeh)

Dices que me olvidaste y en tus ojos veo que mientes (tah)
Ahora puedo decir sufrir de amor lo que se siente
Te sacaré 'e mi mente y eso será de repente
Pero es que tú chica con ese piquete
Dices que me olvidaste y en tus ojos veo que mientes
Ahora puedo decir sufrir de amor lo que se siente (oh-oh-oh)

Al llegar la noche regresarás

No te alejes de mi vida

Llorando de noche, muriendo de día, viviendo esta agonía
No puedo entender que ya no seas mía

Aunque digas que estoy ciego
Desde que te fuiste soy un andariego (W)

Distraído, de tu foto no me despego (heh)

I’ve been tryna help the kids because that’s what I am inclined/
To do/

I try to tell myself that everything gone be okay/
But all these monsters in my head say that they here to stay/

Try not to listen to um/
But they inflicting pain/
These fricken demons in my head they just won’t go away

I start to think that they might just live inside of me/
But then again all these monsters do is lie to me/

At least I think they do/
Or maybe I just hope.../
Cuz if what they say is true well then I don’t know/

What the future holds/

I’m tryna see these brighter days/
But I can’t/
When everything I love always fades away/

Everything I love/
Everything I trust/
Everything I touch/
Always turns to dust/

I used to be more open now I stay alone in privacy
When I was open people really never understood
So now I lie to people’s faces I say that I’m good

Well then don’t ask how I am
I think that’s why nobody talks to me cuz they don’t understand
So I just keep my struggles to myself

And my smile don’t make me happy, if you think that you’re mistaken
Because every single day I swear I think my body’s breakin
And I feel like I’ve seen gods face
Still question faith
If I make one more mistake
Then I swear ima break

Hi, aight, whatever, you doing too much
You doing too much
Ayy

[Verse 1]
Let's go back to the time when your nigga used to trip
'Bout the time we spent, girl, when we were just friends
It was all friendly on my end
Even though I look forward to seeing you again like, uh
When am I seeing you again?
Ayy, when are we speaking again?
Yeah, you look good with that ink on your skin
Hood, but you far from the streets you was in, oh yeah
No, he don't like it, call me up, he don't like it
This was the perfect timing
Love you, I'm certain I can, yeah
Talk about you like a queen makin' him madder
As if he never even mattered
And you a bad bitch, you keep getting badder
This ain't the side nigga anthem
I've been straight forward, he's going backwards

[Interlude]
Relax, yo, just chill
I love you, I’m with you
I ain’t with this nigga
You don’t think I…
He’s my best friend, he’s my brother
That’s my brother!
He ain’t your brother
That your blood?
You got the same momma and daddy?
Aight babe
You fuckin that nigga, that’s what it is
I’m fucking my brother? That’s my brother…
No, no, if y'all ain’t got the same momma and daddy, y'all can fuck
You fuckin’ him

[Verse 2]
You was on the verge of losing her
You was acting like you ain't want shit to do with her
I cut out the bullshit and kept it true with her
That's why the sexual tension is high when I'm in rooms with her
She really the shit, I don't be juicing her
I'm the shit too, that's why I'm so in tune with her
I feel like I'm sewn on ya
I feel like you grew on me
Have I grown on you?
Done fronting like I don't want you
Keep treating me like I don't know you
Back and forth between me and all your niggas
You're busy tonight, that figures
Tonight you're staying in his city
And still I answer your call when he doesn't answer at all
But I want that too, that's all
I need the same in return, that's all

Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave, granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation
2Pac of my generation, blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'
Dedication
It's dedication, look

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said, ""You do a song with Nip, K. Dot he a better Crip""
I said, ""He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?""
Level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol' up

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Look
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be, ""Stay safe,"" now it's, ""Stay dangerous""
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense, nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end, nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil', tour the world, dawg, my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]

Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me

Me, I'm just the same kid
That fucked around and made it
Fucked over my main chick
Damn, she was the main chick
Thinkin' 'bout the game
I shouldn't have played, but I played it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And now I'm missing your love, I'ma roll up
I'm faded once again, ooh, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you (ooh)
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart (woah)
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
(Now, I mean, yeah)
Uh, I blame it on the distance
That's why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
A text pops up, she's like, ""Who is this?""
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, yeah, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think, think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off, yeah
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
(You tell me, uh, yeah)
Uh, I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, 'till I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold-out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel, ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, I don’t know where I am, ooh
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh, yeah
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you, ha (ooh)
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

Cried and dried these tears

[Verse 1]
I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ
Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin

Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

The ESU team is shackling Luke for arrest.

COP: All right, here's the plan. Triple-cuff him. Alpha team, you take point positions in the convoy. Bravo team will bring up the rear. Remember, we're clear to engage, so if he so much as looks at you funny, light him up.

COP: Copy that. You hear that, freak? I got something special for you.

LUKE: This isn't necessary.

COP: Yeah, it is.

Misty is looking on from her ambulance. She gets up and starts walking towards Luke.

PARAMEDIC: No. You need to let us finish. Ms. Knight...Ms. Knight!

MISTY: It's Detective Knight, and I'm fine. (to the ESU guy) I need a moment with Cage.

ESU GUY: Misty, we have special orders.

MISTY: Mario, come on. I was just held hostage. I just need a minute with him.

ESU GUY: All right. We'll be right here. We got your back.

COP: Clear!

MISTY (ostentatiously): You going down. It's about damn time. Cottonmouth, Officer Albini, what just popped off in there? ...Look, your friend is in the wind. They've got public enemy number one in handcuffs for the whole world to see so they're not looking for anybody else. Every officer in your detail has those modified Judas bullets. I wouldn't try anything if I were you...before I got to the precinct.
You're not that crazy, are you?

LUKE: Always.

MISTY: Take his ass to jail.

COP: Come on.

COP: All right, let's go. We're rolling.

They load Luke into the truck and drive away. The two cops in the front seat discuss him.

COP 1: Three sets of cuffs? Isn't that overkill?

COP 2: The camera's on. We need to look like we're in control.

COP 1: It's a shit detail. You'd think ESU would be in the back with those guns pointed at him.

COP 2: We've got the same guns and bullets they do.

COP 1: You know, my wife says it's the end of days, people like him popping up.

COP 2: They've been saying that since Eve bit the apple. Cage? He's evolution.

COP 1: Whatever he is, it's just scary. Makes me feel small. Insignificant.

COP 2: Insecure? You know what they say. Once you go black, you never go back. At least that's what your wife keeps telling me.

COP 1: I was fast asleep when she came home. Your daughter already wore me out.

In the back of the van, Luke easily breaks his shackles.

COP 2: Just sit tight.

COP 1: God damn it. Homeless lady. Can't they move her out of the way?

COP 1 (To the woman, over megaphone): You are in the path of a police convoy. Clear the road immediately.

Luke breaks out of the van and runs.

COP 1 (over megaphone): Cage must not escape. Fire at will!

The cops chase Luke through alleys. Luke comes to a dead end and slams into a side door. He slips through the building and ocmes out on the other side. He sees a police car drive past him and relaxes, but then hears the sound of a shotgun behind him.

COP 2: Young cops always wanna chase somebody. Me? I'd rather be where they're already going. They told us these Judas bullets can kill someone like you. You don't want to die? Don't run.

LUKE: I'd rather die than go back to prison.

COP 2: Live free or die? You wanna get all New Hampshire about this shit? Fine with me. Cop killers don't survive these streets.

LUKE: I didn't kill a cop. My problem isn't with you or yours. It's much bigger than that.

COP 2: Some people are calling you a hero for what you did. Connie's, Pop's...

LUKE: I'm no hero. But I do need to take out the person responsible for all this.

COP 2: You don't recognize me, do you?

LUKE: I've seen you at Pop's before.

COP 2: Pop cut my hair for 12 years. He didn't think he was a hero, either. He was just trying to do some right after years of wrong....I hope I'm right about you. More people rooting for you than you think.

The cop lowers his gun.

LUKE: What are you gonna tell your people?

COP 2: The truth. I had you in my sights, but you outran me. I'm getting old...Luke? You better catch that slippery son of a bitch.

Luke turns and leaves.

OPENING THEME

DIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE

THEMBI WALLACE (newscast): Moments after the tumultuous events at Harlem's Paradise, fugitive and alleged cop killer Luke Cage was brought out in handcuffs. And now the city's most...

TURK: Hey, I'm glad you called me, Willis. Luke Cage is on the run. They got Shades in bracelets, but they're gonna be onto you before long, brother. Best believe that. Getting ghost and liquidizing your cash, that was the right move.

STRYKER: I wouldn't touch any of that. People don't test me more than once.

TURK: I overstand. What you need me for?

STRYKER: I understand you're a man of discretion and taste with numerous connections willing to pay full price for my wares. I can still collect from the shadows.

Zip comes in, wearing a pair of sunglasses.

ZIP: Bad news, Diamondback.

STRYKER: Take those off!

ZIP: I went to your crib. The files you had are gone.

Stryker walks over to Zip and grabs his throat, choking him and pushing him to the ground. He holds him there for a moment before he starts to laugh and lets him go.

STRYKER: I had you, didn't I? I couldn't resist. I like you, Zip. You've got ambition. It'll take you far as long as you stay in your place. The first of the 48 laws of power. Never outshine the master. That was the mistake Shades made. He questioned me. He doubted me. He tried to reach too far. He was on some Icarus shit. Do you know who that is?

ZIP:  Yeah, he had a verse with Kendrick.  Right?

TURK: No Icarus was the boy who flew too close to the sun with fake wings.

ZIP: Shades is no problem. He's still in custody.

STRYKER: Not for long.

ZIP: You gonna blow the joint up?

STRYKER: No, he's going to be bailed out.

ZIP: The hell for? That don't make no sense!

STRYKER: See? The questioning. That's how it starts...I'm gonna have an opening. You gonna step up?

ZIP: I'm down to do whatever you need. No problem.

STRYKER: Good boy. So are you down?

TURK: I'm down. As long as the business is business, I'm good with it. Till then, I'm out of here, man.

ZIP: Show Turk out, Zip.

TURK: Romeo would roll over in his grave, the way you hop-skipping with these cats nowadays. He was a man on these streets. You's a boy.

ZIP: What the hell are you talking about? You're down here in his pocket, same as me.

TURK: I'm doing business with him, yes. But I ain't his boy. And I definitely ain't his bitch.

Turk leaves, and Zip walks back to Stryker.

ZIP: These old-ass niggas talkin' about shit they don't even know about. So what's in the box?

STRYKER: One of the seven deadly sins, my boy which I plan to unleash on dear old Carl.

ZIP: Which one?

STRYKER: Wrath.

COLON'S GYM

ERNESTO (in Spanish): This Diamondback needs to be dealt with.

ADVISER (in Spanish): Ernesto is right, Domingo. This is the perfect time to do it. We've got the muscle. Plus, with the Cuban, Jamaican, Dominican and Haitian leaders dead, we can control the drugs, guns, all of it and walk out like kings.

DOMINGO (in English): I was there when he took them all out. Right next door. We got the drugs. We got that money. But with the guns, we can control everything. Here, the islands, further south...We'd be unstoppable. Hmm?

ERNESTO (in Spanish) So what are you saying?

DOMINGO: We take him out. We go after what's ours. Let's go find Diamondback.

THE STATIONHOUSE

Shades is standing for his mugshot. Misty watches him through the window.

OFFICER: Turn and face the camera.

RIDLEY: You're supposed to be in the hospital. Push yourself too hard too soon and you could make it worse, you know.

MISTY: I appreciate your concern.

RIDLEY: No, you don't. I need you at 100%.

MISTY: I need to prove Luke Cage is innocent.

RIDLEY: Well, the hostages have all been consistent that Luke Cage never held them at gunpoint.

MISTY: He was set up. You know it, Priscilla. Half this damn department knows it. We need to be going after Willis Stryker.

RIDLEY: Well, then why is Luke Cage running?

MISTY: He's a black man being chased by the cops oh, with special bullets. Accused of killing a cop, and you're asking why he's running? Come on.

RIDLEY: Look at how relaxed Hernan ""Shades"" Alvarez is. He knows he's not going anywhere anytime soon, so he's resting up. He knows he's guilty. See this perp? Look how his foot is bouncing. Nervous. No wonder his street name is Sugar. I don't even have to say a word, and here come the waterworks. He's probably innocent or less guilty than whoever he's about to give up.

MISTY: That's a detectives' wives' tale. You can't prove guilt or innocence by that.

RIDLEY: Oh, but you can...because Luke gave you his word.

MISTY: Luke...

RIDLEY: Right now, his actions are speaking louder than his words.

MISTY: Luke Cage saved my life.

RIDLEY: I don't dispute that we should be bringing in Diamondback, but to get to the truth, we need to bring them both in.

MISTY: Okay, well, let me lead the charge. Make sure Luke is brought in safely.

RIDLEY: He threw away his chance when he jumped out that damn van. Now they will shoot him on sight with the mayor's blessing.

MISTY: You know what? At least let me take a crack at Shades. He's in deep with all the players. He doesn't scare me.

RIDLEY: Detective...

MISTY: I can handle him.

RIDLEY: You just got shot. I need you to go home, get some rest. I'll interview Shades.

THE RUINED HARLEM'S PARADISE

MARIAH: My grandmother loved Harlem's Paradise. She took care of all the small details. She loved it. From the murals the glasswork, all the way down to the table linens. No fine point was overlooked. This was her legacy. My family's in tatters, and it's all because of Diamondback. Shit! Uh, I know, I know I need to get out in front of this. Release a statement about Damon Boone and how much I respected him.

ALEX: That is not what I was gonna say.

MARIAH: Well, yeah, just Please, no lectures.

ALEX: This is just a thing. Things can be rebuilt, and when you do, you rebuild it as your legacy. Not just the clubs. I want to be a part of that...Here's what I think. Controlling the narrative is everything. We can't have any loose threads. So anyone who might have overheard anything you said to Diamondback or Shades in here is a threat.

MARIAH: You're absolutely correct.

ALEX: How may I be of service?

MARIAH: I wouldn't want you to do anything untoward.

ALEX: Never.

MARIAH: Okay.

THE STREETS OF HARLEM

Luke is skulking around in daylight, in his bullet-riddled hoodie.He hides from a police car, then sees two men pull on balaclavas and enter a bodega.

LUKE: I don't have time for this.

Inside the bodega, one robber is holding a gun on the owner and Method Man while the other empties the register.

ROBBER 1: Don't move. He'll blow your head off. He's crazy like that. Don't try no shit.

The robber suddenly recognizes Method Man. He pulls up his mask

ROBBER 1: My bad, Meth. I grew up on that Wu-Tang shit. But you know how it is.

METHOD MAN: Are you serious? Are you really trying to have a conversation right now?

ROBBER 1: I'm just tryin'...I'm just sayin'...You're the man, yo.

ROBBER 2: Pull your mask down! You supposed to be watchin' the damn door, Bryce!

BRYCE: What I say about using my government name, Michael?

Luke walks in

BRYCE: Damn, homie. You look like you went through a cheese grater. Oh, snap, you Luke...

Luke smacks Bryce hard enough to knock him into a display. Michael panics and shoots at Luke several times.

MICHAEL: I ain't mean that.

LUKE: Give me your phone. The phone, fool.

MICHAEL: Yo, my bad, man. You know, I just got a little nervous and shit when you threw my mans across the...

Luke flicks Michael in the head and knocks him out.

METHOD MAN: It's you. Yeah, it's you.

LUKE: No, man, it's you. Yo, man, ""P.L.O. Style"" was my joint back in the day. Sweet Christmas. Yeah, man, one second.

Luke makes a phone call.

LUKE: Hey, it's me...Yeah, they'll be looking for me. I'll lay in the cut. I'll see you in a few.

Luke puts the phone away, looks to Method Man.

LUKE: You a double XL?

METHOD MAN: Way ahead of you, homie.

They trade hoodies. Luke takes a minute to destroy the robbers' gun.

LUKE: Call the cops.

BODEGA OWNER: I know a lot of people who would pay you for this kind of protection.

LUKE: They can keep their money.

METHOD MAN: Salute...You ever see anything like that before?

BODEGA OWNER: Harlem, baby. Harlem.

THE STATIONHOUSE

Misty is walking down the hall. Her phone rings.

MISTY: Hello?

CANDACE: Detective Knight?

MISTY: Candace?

CANDACE: Yeah.

MISTY: What number are you calling me from?

CANDACE: A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS. I need to see you.

MISTY: Come into the precinct.

CANDACE: No. No. You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.

MISTY: You didn't wanna talk to me before. What makes you trust me now?

CANDACE: Because Luke Cage does. He saved my life. And you saw right through me. You want the truth, right?

MISTY: Where are you?

CANDACE: Look, if you can't help...

MISTY: Candace.

CANDACE: Tell me a place, and I will be there.

INTERROGATION ROOM

RIDLEY: You should be at Rikers right now, but I held you because I think you have something to say.

SHADES: Lawyer.

RIDLEY: I know your record, Mr. Alvarez. Came up in Harlem, rolled around with Cottonmouth in the late '90s, spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing, then you made it to the big time, went to Seagate.

SHADES: Lawyer.

RIDLEY: Cornell Stokes is dead, but you're still alive. And I've never seen an arraignment happen so quickly. Two million dollar bail and someone paid it in cash. Who's your new sponsor? Is it Willis Stryker?

SHADES: Law...yer.

RIDLEY: You were part of a hostage situation, Hernan. Even if your lawyer does get you out you won't be walking away from that. That's multiple kidnapping and weapons charges. How does 25 years to life sound to you? Minimum.

SHADES: Are you serious?

RIDLEY: Yep.

SHADES: Okay. Okay. I I was in the club. I saw what happened. I know who did it.

RIDLEY: Okay. We can protect you, but I need a name to verify. Who was it? Was it Stryker?

SHADES: He goes by...lawyer. You need me to spell it?

Shades laughs Ridley out the door.

THE WATERSIDE

CANDACE: You call this safe?

MISTY: We're hiding in plain sight. I've got you...For now. Lie to me again, Candace, I walk away from here, and you are on your own.

CANDACE: It's not bullshit.

MISTY: We'll see. How did you even get out of Harlem's Paradise without being stopped?

CANDACE: They were so busy trying to arrest Luke, I just walked away.

MISTY: So what is it? What do you need to tell me that's so important?

CANDACE: I was at the club the night Cottonmouth died.

MISTY: I already know that.

CANDACE: I mean right after.

Misty deliberately takes out her phone and holds it up so Candace can see her touch the ""record"" button.

CANDACE: Mariah killed him.

Misty pictures herself in Harlem's Paradise as Shades and Mariah cover up the crime.

SHADES (flashback):The trash bag is for the clothes you're wearing now. Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too. Someone from Spurlock's will incinerate them....The secret to any good lie is it has to run parallel to the truth....

MISTY: How do you know this?

CANDACE:  I heard them talking about it.

SHADES (flashback): ...do what I say...

CANDACE: The guy who always wears sunglasses, he was there. It was his idea to say Luke Cage killed Cottonmouth. I was so scared. I snuck out of there, back to the lockers.
And, um, I was trying to calm myself down. When I went upstairs, the guy with the glasses offered me $50,000 to tell a story. So I told one.

MISTY: Why are you coming clean now?

CANDACE: 'Cause I can't live with this. Especially after Luke saving my life. If you can guarantee my safety, I will testify about everything I just told you.

Misty stops recording and puts her phone away.

Mariah scares me more than Cottonmouth. I asked her if she thought Luke did it, mostly to see if I could trust her. To see if she would tell me the truth. She looked me right in my eye and said ""You never know what anyone is capable of."" It was the way she said it. She...she would kill me if she knew I was speaking to you, I truly believe that. Thank you for helping me.

MISTY: I'm gonna nail Mariah Dillard's ass to the wall. Who else knows that you're here?

CANDACE: Just my friend Leslie.

MISTY: Don't call anyone else, not even Leslie. As a matter of fact, give me your phone. Come on.

CANDACE: Okay.

Misty hands her a new burner.

MISTY: Now, I picked this up on the way, just in case. It's already got my number programed in there, so if I call or text, you know it's me.

CANDACE: Is your arm okay?

MISTY:  My trigger finger is just fine.
Come on, let's go.

CANDACE: Where?

MISTY: Soledad's. Her daughter Claire is the one who treated your ankle at Harlem's Paradise. She'll be there, too. I'm gonna take you there myself.

Nearby, Alex watches them from a car.

SWAY'S STUDIO

METHOD MAN: No lie. Bullets was flying everywhere and shit.

HEATHER B:You trying to tell me that those are bullet holes? Man, Meth, I love you, but get out of here. I don't believe that.

METHOD MAN: HB, I thought the same thing until shorty pulled the biscuit and let two off on Cage and they bounced off. Bullets ricochetin' and shit. Look, I'm telling y'all the truth. I see y'all over there, y'all don't believe it.
Trust me, it's the truth. And after he smacked fire out these dudes, he left the hoodie, told me and Gomez to call the police...You know I ain't calling no po-po...Then he bounced.

SWAY: Say word.

METHOD MAN: Word, Sway. I'm telling you. He even balled the dude's gun up like some old homework.

HEATHER B: But my thing is, though, if he innocent, so what he running for?

METHOD MAN: Bulletproof always gonna come second to being black. HB, you should know that. You from Jers. Jers!

SWAY: Wow! Sound like he stunted on you right there.

HEATHER B: He did stunt. It was a stunt. It was a stunt. Why you gotta stunt on me?

METHOD MAN: No, I mean, seriously. Seriously, though, what I'm just saying, like, if that was me, and I was on the run...Why even get involved? But he did. And those dudes was nervous, so anything could've happened. As far as I'm concerned, Luke Cage saved my life, man.

SWAY: That's what's up, man. You know what, that don't sound like no cop killer to me.

METHOD MAN: For real, for real. You know, there's somethin' powerful about seeing a black man that's bulletproof and unafraid. Come on, y'all. You know? Streets got mad love for Cage. I got mad love for Cage, man, and and he one of ours.

SWAY: But you know what? We got mad love for you, too.

HEATHER B: No doubt.

SWAY: You one of ours, man. You know, the show's almost over, man. You gonna spit for us?

METHOD MAN: Of course.

SWAY: Oh, man! He 'bout to spit! Citizens, you are in for a treat. One of the best to pick up the mic, the one and only Method Man!

METHOD MAN: Hey, yo, Sway. You all ready? I'mma dedicate this one to the hardest individual on the street right now. Luke Cage, you already know. ""Bulletproof Love"" your way, brother.

During this song we see a montage of cops trying to track down Luke Cage, stopping black men with bullet-riddled hoodies. However, the whole of Harlem has started to wear them. Gomez the bodega owner is selling them to a huge crowd.

Let's get it.
Listen.
Man, it is what it is
Can't understand a man if you ain't lived what he lived
Roaches in the crib, ain't got no food up in the fridge
Plus the crime running rampant and it's screwing up the kids
Sway, admit, what kind of paradise is this?
I just want my 40 acres and some carats on the wrist
But these snakes is trying to gather in the pit
When you get a cottonmouth, plucking ashes off the clip
Off the rip, now a challenger exists
And he bulletproof, shoot, what kind of caliber is this?
Got thugs in the store with the barrel on your lips
Saying, ""empty out the drawer"" before he pound you with the grip
Lord, who to call when no one obeys the law
And there ain't no Iron Man that can come and save us all?
Power to the people and Luke Cage the cause
And the cops got it wrong, we don't think Cage involved
Look, dog, a hero, never had one
Already took Malcolm and Martin, this is the last one
I beg your pardon, somebody pulling a fast one
Now we got a hero for hire and he a black one
And bullet-hole hoodies is the fashion
We in Harlem's Paradise, tell the Captain
That I'm about to trade the mic for a Magnum
Give up my life for Trayvon to have one

[Hook: Method Man]
Yeah, 'cause this is bulletproof love
And you already know what a bulletproof does
So you can take it from a bulletproof thug
The hood got his back, dog, bulletproof love
The blood thicker than mud
And who am I to judge if you get a gun in the club?
'Cause you already know what a bulletproof does
When the hood got your back, dog, bulletproof love

[Outro: Method Man]
Yeah, shoutout to Pop. RIP, my brother. The streets is crazy nowadays. People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one whether you like it or not. Luke Cage, please believe it, sir. The streets got your back. You already bulletproof love, baby
The streets is crazy right now, you know what I'm sayin'? People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one. Whether you like it or not, Luke Cage, please believe it, sir, the streets got your back. You're already bulletproof love, baby!

SWAY: Yeah! That was dope. You got it right here on Sway's Universe. The homie, Method Man, HB, and the bulletproof thug, Luke Cage.
Law enforcement is in a frenzy looking for Luke Cage.

THE BARBERSHOP

THEMBI WALLACE NEWSCAST: There have been numerous false sightings, with some people wearing hoodies with holes as a sign of solidarity with an outlaw some people still perceive to be a hero.

SWAY: Sway in the Morning. What's on your mind, citizen?

CALLER: Yo, I remember when Larry Davis was on the run back in the day. Cops came at him 'cause they were just as corrupt, dangerous and jacked up as he was. I don't think we're getting the full story on Luke Cage yet, for real.

Fish is listening to Sway and watching Thembi on the news at the Barbershop.

SWAY: I wouldn't put it past the government, man. Um, you know, we're gonna be searching for the answers for you, and once we get the facts, we're gonna put it right here on Sway's Universe, all right? Thanks for your call, citizen. We got another person on the line...

Fish changes the station to jazz. Plainclothes officers rush in to raid the shop.

OFFICERS: Now! Come on! All right.

FISH: Oh, come on, man. You know he's not here.

Smith walks over to Fish's chessboard.

SMITH: I understand playing against the computer, but, um, how do you beat yourself?

FISH: Chess is a game of anticipation. If you know every single possible move, you can anticipate your adversary's next move before he does.

SMITH: Oh. That's deep. If we find out you've been hiding him, there'll be hell to pay.

FISH: Yeah, well, just don't break the hinges on that door on your way out. I just got it fixed.

The cops drive away. Luke watches them go and comes into the shop.

FISH: That was a close shave.

LUKE: Bad pun.

FISH: What the hell did you even come back for, man?

LUKE: I had to. For Harlem. Take care of Diamondback before he made it bad for everybody.

FISH: Well, forget Harlem. Forget your brother! You're on the road in a brand new car and a woman that fine? And you're bulletproof. You'd have never seen my black ass again. I'd rob the occasional bank and never look back. You got every cop in the city looking for you, brother. Negroes writing Luke Cage ballads and shit. So what's the plan?

LUKE: To box in all the players.

FISH: Well, Shades is in jail. Mariah's out, but she ain't exactly on your side. Now you could tail both of 'em, but no telling how long that'll take for them to lead you to your prey. What about Misty?

LUKE:  No, she's got her hands full already. She's trying to clear my name inside the precinct and bring me in at the same time. We gotta be careful with her.

FISH: That leaves you one other option. Someone else to find Diamondback. Here. Turk.

Fish gets up and goes to the wall phone.

LUKE: Turk may be a pawn, but he's not dumb. If he thinks he's being set up, he'll disappear.

FISH: You let me worry about that. Hey, Turk, it's Bobby. Listen, I might be able to get my hands on about 30 pairs of Jordans. They're the vintage Air Jordan 5s.
Let's just say they fell off the back of a truck...Okay, when?

INTERROGATION ROOM

Ridley walks in with an unfamiliar woman.

SHADES: Who's this?

RIDLEY: First name ""Law,"" last name ""Yer."" Must be pretty damn connected to get a lawyer and not even know who she is.

SHADES: Membership has its privileges.

In the hall, Misty bumps into Shades on his way out.

MISTY: He sprung you? You think this is funny, don't you? You got this all figured out, huh?

SHADES: No. Actually, I don't.

UNDER A BRIDGE

Zip, Shades, and some minions get out of a car.

SHADES: When did Diamondback bring in new hires?

ZIP: Well, after the club, he had to change things up. Recruit some new faces.

They all walk into an abandoned factory.

ZIP: I bet while you were inside, cops tried to do some recruiting of their own.

SHADES: Don't ever question my loyalty.

They all step into a old service elevator.

SHADES: The man upstairs?

ZIP:  You are just full of questions. Matter of fact...

Zip wraps a cord around Shades' neck to strangle him. The other minions wait impassively. Shades struggles until he grabs a minion's gun and starts shooting, taking out the minions before even breaking free from Zip. He turns on Zip last, holding the gun on him.

SHADES: Let's go to the penthouse.

THE ROOF

ZIP: I was just following orders!

SHADES: You're a goddamn puppet. Who gave you the order? Who?

ZIP: Diamondback! You stopped playing your position. Asked too many questions. Diamondback said you needed to be dealt with.

SHADES: Romeo would be ashamed of you. You're such a disappointment.

ZIP: You're the second person who told me that today. I'm my own man, Shades.

SHADES: Tell him yourself.

Shades shoots Zip in the head. He finds the sunglasses in Zip's pocket.

SHADES: Nice...Sorry, Romeo He had to go.

MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE

MARIAH: It's a good thing her friend Leslie knew where she was. I'm glad you found the park. So where is she now?

ALEX: She left with Detective Knight. Traffic got thick and I lost them. I'm sorry. I'm not used to doing anything like this.

MARIAH: We'll find her again. Just knowing that she can't be trusted is helpful. You did a good job, Alex. Hey, you're my rock! Later.

Mariah's phone rings. She puts in an earbud before she answers to speak on her headset.

MARIAH: What do you want?

STRYKER (over the phone): That's no way to speak to a business partner.

MARIAH: After what you did to my club, do you really think I'm gonna shuck and jive with you?

STRYKER (over the phone): You might wanna check your attitude. If you're not of any use to me, then you're not useful to anyone. Shades would tell you, if he was still alive.

MARIAH: What the hell are you talking about?

STRYKER (over the phone): I had to let him go.
So now, I'm giving you the chance to tell me where you stand. I've taken Shades and Damon Boone off the table so you can grow. I'd hate for us to part, too.

MARIAH: I wasn't particularly fond of Shades and the death of Damon Boone, although unnecessary, was appreciated. But you need to know this. I'm out of the political game. I'm focusing on Harlem's Paradise. Using it for a a power base for community relations.

Instead of answering over the phone, Styker comes into the room.

STRYKER: That's a smart move. But you've made some dumb ones also. You should never talk about murder on an open line.

He drops a duffel bag in front of her.

STRYKER: Open it. Seed money for your New Harlem Renaissance project and refurbishing the club. My apologies.

MARIAH: It's a very generous donation but nothing in this world is free.

STRYKER: You're right. My only condition is loyalty. Stick with me and Harlem will be remade in your own image. We'll be doing this for years to come.

MARIAH: Harlem is already in my image. You staying?

STRYKER: Once I'm finished with Carl, I'll evaporate. But don't worry. You'll still feel the occasional cool breeze. Sweet dreams, Mariah.

THE STREETS OF HARLEM

Turk is walking down the street. Luke grabs him and pulls him into an alley.

LUKE: You ratted out Chico. You got Pop killed.

TURK: Man, the writing was on the wall. Somebody would have seen him. Might as well be me. How was I supposed to know Tone was gonna shoot up the shop? Whole damn world know Pop's was Switzerland. Forever.

LUKE: I should crush you.

TURK: You won't, though. You need me.

LUKE: Where's Diamondback?

TURK: I don't know.

Luke picks Turk up and holds him high in the air, then throws him into a dumpster and starts to crush it around Turk's body.

LUKE: You still stalling?

TURK: All right! All right! He's at a warehouse by the Harlem River. Near 145th, all right? I gave you what you wanted! Now let me out!

LUKE: Sit tight, Mr. Barrett. Trash pickup is tomorrow. You can breathe just fine. There's food in there, too.

TURK: You can't leave me in here! There's baby diapers in here, man! Hey! Come on!

DIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE

Domingo and his minions are walking through the abandoned warehouse.

DOMINGO: Looks like you downgraded. I liked the club better.

STRYKER: I'm a man who needs his space.

DOMINGO: Space is a good thing. Especially when you come to kill a man.

STRYKER: Whoa, whoa.

Domingo and his guys pull their guns on the seemingly lone Stryker. Stryker's men emerge from the shadows, equally armed.

DOMINGO: Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies. That's not Cage's style so I'm guessing Shades didn't appreciate you bailing him out.

STRYKER: You know when a rattlesnake is at its most dangerous, Domingo? When it's cornered.

Stryker pulls out his guns and starts shooting. There is a long shootout.

DOMINGO: I'm gonna rip your head off!

Eventually Stryker escapes the melee and goes into another room. He opens a crate and a red glow illuminates his face.

STRYKER: ""And behold a pale horse and he that sat upon him, his name was Death.""

MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE

Mariah is counting Stryker's cash and drinking. She gets up and opens a gold box in her living room that has the pearl-handled gun that Cottonmouth used to kill Uncle Pete. Shades comes into the room.

SHADES: You really need a security system. You waiting for me?

MARIAH: No.

SHADES: I bet he told you I was dead. Diamondback got to you, didn't he?

MARIAH: No, he didn't.

SHADES: What are you doing with a gun? It's not you.

MARIAH: Shut up.

SHADES: I have something for you. Figured you'd want this.

He holds out the bottle she used to hit Cottonmouth over the head when she killed him.

SHADES: Your prints, Cornell's blood.

MARIAH: Then you'll have nothing to blackmail me with.

SHADES: I don't need it. We're in this together now.

MARIAH: You and I have come a long way. You know, sometimes you have to reach across the aisle to get things done.

SHADES: You're talking about Luke Cage? It's incredible how much you and I think alike. We're at war. And right now, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

MARIAH: Maybe. But it might not take. You did beat his ass and give him his powers. And Cornell's flunky killed Pop. You think he really is gonna jump? Just jump on our bandwagon?

SHADES: Absolutely. 'Cause we have something that he wants more than anything.

He pulls an official looking manila envelope out of his bag.

His old life. A chance to clear his name. Right here.

MARIAH: If we send Luke after Diamondback and they kill each other all of our problems are swept away. No matter who wins.

SHADES: Even better.

DIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE

Luke breaks the metal door down and sees the results of the firefight. The warehouse is filled with dead bodies. He finds Domingo Colon, who isn't quite dead yet.

DOMINGO: I should've known you'd turn up.

LUKE: What the hell happened here?

DOMINGO: Diamondback.

Luke hears beeping. He follows it to that side room and finds Stryker's crate. It has a bomb inside with a countdown at 45 seconds.

LUKE: Sweet sister.

Cut to Luke running out of the warehouse carrying Domingo.

LUKE: Slow. Take it easy. What did he use? How did Diamondback do that?

DOMINGO: Something I've never seen before. Even you can't stop him.

Domingo dies.

THE STATIONHOUSE

The shot of Domingo's death becomes a crime scene photo on Misty's wall.

MISTY: These just came in.

BAILEY: Elephant punches all over again.

MISTY: Mmm-hmm.

BAILEY:That's gotta be Cage, right?

Misty's cell phone rings.

MISTY: Hello?

LUKE (over the phone): Hey, it's me. You guys find Domingo?

MISTY: Yeah.

LUKE: Meet me.

MISTY: Where?

She quickly gathers her things and leaves.

THE STREETS OF HARLEM

Misty stops in front of the grated window of an abandoned building. Luke is inside, talking to her through the window.

MISTY: Should I thank you for this?

LUKE: All credit goes to Diamondback.

MISTY: I don't suppose we'll find his body. We found Zip's, though, and two other thugs in an old building. Shot up. Right after they picked up your other boy.

LUKE: Shades. Don't you ever get tired of people getting out?

MISTY: Yes. Look, it's not safe for you to be here. If you don't find Diamondback...

LUKE: Then he wins, and my life is forever a living hell.

MISTY: Is there anything I can do?

LUKE: See what else Turk knows. He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd. Near Mount Olivet and the shop.

MISTY: A dumpster?

OUTSIDE MOUNT OLIVET CHURCH

Mariah and Shades are sitting in a car.

MARIAH: Even if we handle Diamondback he's not gonna forgive us for framing him for Cornell's death.

SHADES: We could hurdle that easy. The only people who know what really happened in the club are you and me.

MARIAH: I'll regret that night for the rest of my life.

SHADES: You did what you had to do. You shouldn't regret that.

MARIAH: What were you even doing at the club that night?

SHADES: I was going there to kill him. You beat me to it.

MARIAH: Cornell never needed my political money. And he was never going to pay it back. He just wanted me in all the way.

SHADES: So what are you saying?

MARIAH: He saw things in me that I avoided my whole life. Now I am becoming that person he always saw and I always denied.

SHADES: You ready?

MARIAH: I stay ready, baby.

They climb out of the car and walk into

THE BARBERSHOP

FISH: I should've kept my coat on. Hell just froze over.

MARIAH: Where's Luke Cage?

LUKE: I'm right here.

SHADES:We have a problem.

LUKE: So do I. I can't decide which one of you I'm gonna knock out first. Where's Diamondback?

SHADES: I don't know. The parley between the three of us is more important.

LUKE: You have the nerve to use that term? Right here? Where Pop died? Cough up Diamondback's location, or I'll stomp you like we were back at Seagate.

FISH: Luke, be cool, brother.

MARIAH: Whoa, whoa. No one needs to stomp anyone. Pops made this place Switzerland for a reason. Cage, we have a mutual enemy, and the only way to bring him down is for us all to come together.

LUKE: There's no way I'm helping you.

MARIAH: We came to offer you a truce. In exchange for helping you find Diamondback, you drop your beef with us.

LUKE: You both framed me for murder. There's nothing you can offer me that's going to make me let that go.

SHADES: How about your freedom? Right here is everything you need to prove that Diamondback framed Carl Lucas.

LUKE: Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated Luke Cage is now wanted for the murder of Cottonmouth.

MARIAH: I'll tell them the truth. Diamondback killed Cornell and Damon Boone. You'll go free.

Misty emerges from the back room.

SHADES:What the hell is this?

MISTY: Mariah Dillard, you're under arrest for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

LUKE: I thought you said you were going after Turk?

MISTY: I've been tracking you since you called. I wasn't going to let you just ghost me again.

LUKE: Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shades, back off! Misty, stand down. We're working this out.

MISTY: Oh, so you workin' with them now?

LUKE: He knows where Diamondback is.

SHADES: I didn't say that.

MISTY: Well, whatever you know, Hernan, you should share it with the whole class.

SHADES: I ain't telling you shit.

Something drops to the ground right outside the shop.

LUKE: Grenade!

Everyone drops to the ground (with Luke between them and the door) to cover their heads. The grenade goes off, blowing out all the windows of the shop. In the chaos Misty drops her phone and Shades picks it up. Stryker comes in wearing a green suit and helmet.

FISH: What the hell? What type of Jean Paul Gaultier shit is this? What are you, a pimp stormtrooper?

STRYKER: No, I'm the angel of death.

SHADES (aside to Mariah): You told him to meet us here?

MARIAH: No.

STRYKER: Damn! Look at Hernan the cockroach. Your mama should have named you Pedro.

Shades lifts his gun and fires at Stryker. The bullets ricochet off of his suit.

MARIAH: Shades!

FISH: God damn it! I just fixed this place up all perfect and shit! Y'all can't take this outside?

LUKE & STRYKER: No.

FISH: All right, just just sayin'.

LUKE (to Misty): Don't let Mariah get away.

MISTY: I won't. Kick his ass, Luke.

STRYKER: You know I'm gonna kill 'em all later, right?

LUKE: You have to get past me first.

STRYKER: Oh, I don't go past. I go through.

They both yell and charge each other before the screen goes black.",194813,7,0.424,0.418,0.548,1.06e-05,0.0945,-6.438,0.0292,151.924,0.46

Deadly fever, please don't ever break

I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame

To love again

Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As

Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony

Popping percs like they was advils

7 summers and they acting like they mad still
Damn, I showed these niggas how that cash feel
I even let em eat my last meal
And any nigga go against the squad, you know I gotta make a call and that man killed (let me pop my shit, uh)
Two maybachs, couple milli, I'm feeling great
So much love when you barely can feel the hate
Them hoes love when you pulling up in that Wraith
For the love of that money your dog'll turn to a snake
Your homie turned to a rat, he is fighting his case
They talked in that federal and he praying they keep his state
He praying to make it home
But you ain't answer your phone
Cause it's word on the street, them people didn't put him on
He got your name to 'em like several times
Trying to put you in a cell 'til you 75
Should've knew it when that nigga said ""I'm telling my mom""
Them people grabbed you and you wasn't surprised
What a nightmare
I'm having flashes about that corner selling, that right there
Cops riding past, '40 on me I got it right here
And I ain't trying to lose nigga
Play it by the rules nigga

Fuck you like the pornstar, just don't lose your cool nigga

Bust down, Patek, diamonds jump out the face
Fear of god on me, I got nothing but faith
Like where the love, I'm feeling nothing but hate
I'm from a hood where before you make it to the morgue niggas will come to your place
Day 1's all in your crib trying to touch in your safe

The lights will come on
That don't mean we can't take
The long way home, home, home

'Cause I'm already thinking about you and me
Getting out of here and taking a drive
Just slide a little closer
Put your head on my shoulder
Like this ain't our first time
Girl don't worry 'bout holding on tight
'Cause I'm already callin'
I'm already callin' you mine

If you like the way that sounds
We can leave this place right now, right now

Girl I've never seen you in this town
If you need somebody to show you around
Well, I know somebody
It's a little too loud to talk in here
And your eyes are saying you wanna disappear
Well, I know a place and
I know somebody

Somebody with a gassed up truck
Sitting right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody
And you're looking right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody)
I know somebody (I know somebody)

[Verse 2:]
I'm loving the way you act so shy
Like you ain't so sure
Like you can't decide
But I heard you tell your friends
That you know somebody
That makes you laugh
That can get you home
That might make you fall ‘fore the night is gone
So come on, you know
I'm that somebody

Sipping coffee in a corner booth

Then you shot me that smile

Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you

When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy

In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me

And she said... “You a goddamn lie”
I ain't mean to say that shit, girl, I was goddamn high
So we left the crib now we in the goddamn ride
She lookin' goddamn fine
I wanted a bitch who was down to Earth
But she want the goddamn sky, uh
List of my problems
Got this one on my line that won't stop fucking callin'
It's crazy I made her that way
Every time I see her out, I see the hate in her face
Like why you do that?
Tell her you love her when next week you just want your space
Why you do, why you do that?
Tell her you want her but next week you do your own thing
Why you do, why you do that?
I can't explain it but just know it working for me
She text me “I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you”
But how the fuck can you hate me?
When I ain't did shit, but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I never been the one to try to explain
While you catch them feels I'ma sip on this drank, it's easing my brain

[Chorus]
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit
('Bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit
('Bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank

[Verse 2]
Now I'm like
It's a goddamn shame
We done crashed, we done burned
But baby you the goddamn blame
See I wanted love but you wanted goddamn fame
Every goddamn thang
I wanted a bitch who was on the move
But you want to goddamn lay
Uh, list of my problems
Got this one in my bed and she just wants to sleep
Fucking up all of the sheets
She only wake up to eat
Do this shit every week
Like, why you do that?
Crying you want to be great, but sleepin' until the next day
Why you do that?
Don't got that much in the bank, we go out she order the steak
Why you do, why you do that?
She can't explain it but just know it working for her
She claiming she down on her luck but really she don't give a fuck
And I cannot make this shit up
And I ain't did shit but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I won't be the one to try to explain
While you catch them feels, I'ma sip on this drank, it's easing the pain

Drop the towel right in front of me, you cruel

That was in there way before we started dating

Lay down, baby, I'ma take it slow
Can't let this thing go to waste, oh no

Call, then I got to your place, oh no
Still getting voicemail, oh no
Fuck it, leave a voicemail, oh no

Won't shoot her but I will gun-butt the bitch
When we say ""Fuck the bitch,"" dick up the bitch
She was stuck-up so my niggas stuck up the bitch

Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things

[Припев: XXXTENTACION]
Не плачь, не уходи
Не буду лгать - я чертовски тебя люблю
О да!

[Куплет 1: Lil Wayne]
Ты смотришь в облака
Это я поднимаюсь или они опускаются?
Я вижу смерть за углом
А знак разворота выглядит как улыбка
Что же мне теперь делать? Кто меня теперь найдет и как?
Некуда идти, кроме как по кругу
Еще один ниггер, который потерял голову
Нет, гребаный король, который забыл свою корону
Я не номер один и это правда
Я номер 9-27-82
Дальтоник, даже если я синий
Моя тарелка полна, это не моя любимая еда
Но я голоден, так голоден
Мне нужно мое родовое дерево рядом с денежным деревом
С кучей листьев в Эдемском саду
С кучей Eves, фруктовым пуншем
Я пью из фонтана молодости
Так что, если я умру молодым - обвиню сок
Похороните меня в Новом Орлеане
И напишите на плите: «Не плачь, следи за ней»
Верни меня к жизни
Потерять жизнь ради жизни
Но если рай настолько хорош, как о нем говорят
Я хочу трехкратное продление моей чертовой жизни
Покойся с миром

[Припев: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь)
Не уходи (почему? ну почему?)
Не буду лгать, я чертовски тебя люблю
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь, не плачь)
Не пойди (почему? почему? почему? ну почему?)
Не будет лгать (не плачь, не плачь)
Я чертовски тебя люблю (не плачь, не плачь)

[Куплет 2: Lil Wayne]
Талант дан Богом, будь благодарен
Слава не дана, будь смиренным
А тщеславие появляется само, будь осторожен
Оставайся на своей собственной полосе, пристегнись
А иногда, когда нет музыки
Мы рождаем наши собственные рога, рум-бум-бум-бум
Эта женщина перенесла будущее
И Tunechi родился как «dun-dun-dun-dun»
Не называйте это возвращением
Было темно, а теперь солнце
Мне тяжело, но я повернул назад
Колеса отвалились, я поехал на ободах
Это самоубийством – вопрос жизни и смерти
Это более новые дни и это голубые небеса
Я сказал себе: «Это просто ты и я»
Затем повеял ветер и он свел меня с ума
Господь знает, кто я там
Я делаю последнее дыхание
Мама скажи, чтобы я был осторожен
Голос в голове дает мне нагоняй
Я получил контроль над сознанием
Я потерял контроль, но знал, что найду его
Я позволил Богу контролировать то, что я не могу
Невозможно контролировать слезы, позволить им падать и катиться

[Припев: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь)
Не уходи (почему? ну почему?)
Не буду лгать, я чертовски тебя люблю
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь, не плачь)
Не пойди (почему? почему? почему? ну почему?)
Не будет лгать (не плачь, не плачь)
Я чертовски тебя люблю (не плачь, не плачь)

[Аутро: Lil Wayne]
Не плачь, оставайся с нами
И трехкратно продли мою чертову жизнь
Покойся с миром",,,,,,,,,,,

Ya yo me cansé, no quiero ser tu amante
Te digo de mi parte, que no aguanto más
Ya no aguanto ver el otro como dice que es el dueño tuyo
Me mata el orgullo, él ni te sabe hablar

[Pre-Coro]
Esta la hice pa' él
Cuando la escuche quiero estar ahí para ver
Cuando se entere y sepa que soy dueño de usted
Tal vez suene un poco mal, lo sé y no me luce
Todo es por usted

[Verso 1]
Sólo una cosa te preguntaré
Si tienes frío, ¿quién te da calor?
Yo soy el dueño de tus fantasías
Nadie lo hace como yo

Si te viste bonita, él no te dice na'
Y a mí tú me gustas hasta sin maquillar
Tú siempre a mí me dices que él te trata mal
Y eso lo tienes que acabar

Dime qué tú vas a hacer
Mami, tengo la inquietud
Si quieres sufrir con él
Eso lo decides tú

Que seas feliz con él
Yo no te contestaré
Sé que me vas a llamar
Cuando me extrañe tu piel (tu piel)

She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes

A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write

One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MC's, MC's)
We represent the 313—you know what I’m sayin'?
Yo, they don’t know shit about this, for the '96

[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and to your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue
Turn your system up, twist 'em up
And indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland; I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 2]
Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
A crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral
Is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces
Through telekinesis, it eases you mentally
Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it

[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
To do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
‘Cause there's a monster real in me
That always wants to kill emcees
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool
Then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, ‘cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit, and tempted
When I see the sins my friends commit; I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence

Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (Don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside

You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say, ""A guarantee""
I mean, you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

I don't wanna fight it

Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?

And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad

Last time that I checked, it was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
I been self-made from the dribble
I was been sayin' I'ma kill em, look
Playin' no games with you niggas
Pop clutch, switch lanes on you niggas, look
I laid down the game for you niggas
Taught you how to charge more than what they paid for you niggas
Own the whole thing for you niggas
Re-invest, double up then explained for you niggas
It gotta be love, who run the city? It gotta be cuz
This for the pieces I took off the Monopoly board
And ya'll niggas false claims, it gotta be fraud
Just keep the hood up out your mouth and you gotta be charged
I doubled up, tripled up, nigga what?
Banged on the whole game, I ain't give a fuck
Nobody trippin', had no business, got my digits up
And when I drop, you know I'm 'bout to fuck the city up

And I come through fly (check) no co-sign
I ain't need radio to do mine, I done fine
And I take my time (check) and take my tribe
Every level that I crossed in this game like state lines
It was visionary, either I'm genius or you niggas scary
Maybe it's both and this balance I deliver daily
For every nigga in the streets tryna feed the babies
The single mama's workin' hard not to miss a payment
And dirty money get washed on royalty statements
Black owners in this game of powerful racists
Young niggas in the set that's doin' it makeshift
Out the garage is how you end up in charge
It's how you end up in penthouses, end up in cars
It's how you start off a curb server, end up a boss
It's how you win the whole thing and lift up a cigar
With sweat drippin' down your face 'cause the mission was hard

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was 5 chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set

Last time that I checked, I got the front end and the back
We on the way and that's a fact
This real, this ain't rap, where everybody wanna act pro-black
(They don't really wanna fuck with us) The last lie you heard, this ain't that
This that, ""I done made it out the gutter"" shit
Nip told you ""Fuck the middle man"", I told you ""Fuck a bitch""
Fuck wearin' their clothes, I wear my own shit
Ya'll can own ya'll label, I own my own, bitch!
Aye Nip, I remember all that game you taught me
Don't fuck around and get played by these label owners
Talk that shit to these niggas, Adrien Broner
But secure the win though, don't let that game fold you
Cause when this game over, it's really game over
And all they do is play the game 'til this game over
And you be givin' game like a big brother
Mission, never let 'em take it from us

We know who we are, who we are

Aue, aue
We set a course to find
A brand new island everywhere we roam
Aue, aue
We keep our island in our mind
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

We tell the stories of our elders in a never-ending chain

I wish I could paint our love
These moments in vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Verse 1]
We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
Peach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens
As we laugh over shotguns and tongue kisses
Bubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather
A cold flame, the thrill of no shame
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole

Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay

Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck y'all know about true competition?
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block

Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

Kreisend und es ist nass, als käme es aus Maytag

In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm than show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn’t buying that shit
No I ain't crying a bit man, that's just life that's how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with cupid
He beat you and you went back, who's officially stupid?
Oh yeah I understand that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know that's a bad look
'Cause 20 years from now your daughter probably get her ass whooped
Look, if this too deep for the intro I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect let me introduce
Cole

[Hook: Erykah Badu]
Time to save the world, bearing the world is all the time
So many things I still don't know, so many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes, but I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path, I know my heart will guide me back

[Verse 2]
Yea, man, is this too deep for the intro? If so I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect, let me introduce
It’s Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and mothafuckers that hated school
Said ""that's for busters,"" then heard my shit and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I’m gifted as if I’m Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ayy, possibly cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate so you know a nigga late to my first class
I’d much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?
Wasn't experienced, so nah I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy starin' out my blinds
Till I got free from my mama leash
Running loose through the streets
Like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks can you play, pardon me
Whats your name, don’t mistake me for no lame, no not me
She knew I was on the team cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin’ niggas, even-tu-ally R-I-P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that just how its happens
And if a nigga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
Its funny I barely told nobody I started rapping
'Cause see some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don’t know your dreams, then they can't shoot em down

[Interlude]
Ha, yeah nigga
Hell yeah, I felt that one in my fuckin' soul

I'm prolific, so gifted
I'm the type that's gon' go get it, no kiddin'
Breaking down a Swisher in front of yo buildin'
Sitting on the steps feeling no feelings
Last night, it was a cold killin'
You gotta keep the devil in his hole, nigga
But you know how it go, nigga
I'm front line every time it's on, nigga
Hunnit proof flow, run and shoot pro
458 drop, playin' ""Bulletproof Soul""
Every few shows I just buy some new gold
Circle got smaller, everybody can't go
Downtown diamond district, jewelers like ""Yo
Hussle holler at me, I got Cubans on the low""
Flew to Cancun, smokin' Cubans on the boat
And docked at Tulum just to smoke, look
Listening to music at the Mayan Ruins
True devotion on the bluest ocean, cruisin'
My cultural influence even rival Lucien
I'm integrated vertically, y'all niggas blew it
They tell me, ""Hussle dumb it down, you might confuse 'em""
This ain't that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to
Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""
I'm an urban legend, South Central in a certain section
Can't express how I curbed detectives
Guess it's... evidence of a divine presence
Blessings, help me out at times I seem reckless
F it
Got a L, but got an E for effort, stretch it
Dropped him off in the Mojave desert, and left him
Ain't no answer to these trick questions
Money makin' Nip
Straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser
Well known, flick up and jail pose
Matchin' champagne bottles from Ricos til' T show
Whatever, nigga, we playin' chess, not checkers, nigga
Thirty-eight special for you clever niggas
See bro, if you ain't live and die by the street codes
Been through all these motions, up and down like a see-saw
I can never view you as my equal
Fuck I want to hear your CD for?

Eyes opened, I can see it clear

They don't make it where I'm from, they don't take it here

I can't let these niggas knock me off my pivot
God sat me down and talked to me, I listened
I was in that cell, he told me that I’m gifted
I don't make it in the booth, then I'ma make it in the kitchen
I’m special with the mic, special with the whippin'
I ran out of money, had to pay attention
All the people that was 'round me, they ain't have my best interest
You ain't have my best interest
You lazy with yo' loyalty and yo' position
And now I gotta execute 'cause you don’t listen
That throwaway on me dumpin’ with precision
I know shawty only on my trail 'cause she see a ticket
I’m readin' between the lines and peepin' they intentions
Can't have you niggas around me, shit gon’ go to missing
I had to press that bump, I had to feel it
You know if it ever come down to it, a nigga with it
All these drugs got the whole world jiggy
Hoes comin' out they clothes and niggas trippin'
Why hit the top to go back to the bottom?
All these bitches fallin' for me like it's Autumn
I'm tryna tell you, homie, you don't want none
They freed me so I'm right back to that mon-yun
Somebody tell these niggas they don't want none
Kodak Black but I'm spreadin' blue hundons
They sent my nigga Cool on the fuckin' run
When they let him out of prison, I'll be 31
I knew I was a star when I was sellin' hard
Everybody told me I would make it when I was on the block
See, before this rap shit, I was jackin' cars
I couldn't get all my time 'cause I was doin' fraud
Me and my nigga Lil' Marcus tearin' up the Wyatt
It hurt me to my heart, heard they gave him 25
I'm from the Noya, all I know is slang that iron

Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""fuck"", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas

To terrorize y'all's neighborhood

Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight

The funk of 40 thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)

So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk

As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
""Hello ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something

You've lost… your life.""

I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And I’m not scared of the people who tell me I should be

Everybody from my hood, everybody know I’m good
Sometimes I’m misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading

Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly

Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don’t have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud
I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa
I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha
I’m biracial so bye Felicia

Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Christian Dior on my shoes
They cost a band, I prolly won't wear again
Lil Mizzy just came on the news
I'm thinkin', ""Damn, he back in trouble again""
Made me a mil' 'cause I can
I know who I am, and I give thanks to the man
The tiger just jumped out the can
That's my lil' man, right back gettin' action again
That young nigga shit, we still on it
My dawg goin' through it, I feel for him
She told me she love me, I fell for it
Got real niggas sittin' in jail for it
Buy the pack, I'ma put it in the mail for it
On the hunt for the money, I smell for it
I went big dawg on them, this Tom Ford
That lil' boy shit I ain't goin' for it
Gettin' money every day I wake up
Don't ask me, ""Did me and lil' shawty break up?""
Them M's comin' in, let 'em stack up
Don't ride my wave, dawg, back up
I ain't never had shit, I gotta act up
Don't come too close, my dawgs wan' buck
I don't need no help, I don't ask for much
If I ever go broke, we maskin' up

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Ran the money up, way up
Life ain't sweet, ain't no lay-up
Drip for sale, they gotta pay us
I stayed down and I came up
Stayed the same and they changed up
I knew they was gon' change up
Money never gon' change us
I just be in my lane stuck

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I parked the Bentley inside the garage
I don't know how much hate I can dodge
I can get you knocked off with a nod
4 Pockets Full, everyone got a knot
I say this shit from the heart
I knew you weren't real, you weren't there from the start
Anything good in my way came from God
Go get on stage and I get an applause
Damn Young Gunna done growed up
Back to back the coupes, they know it's us
My bro took a loss and I picked him up
We stick together, they ain't rich as us
I wanna sit down, she ain't lit enough
Every time I count cash, swear I get a rush
My money long as the yellow bus
It ain't no secret, I'm livin' plush

Ran the money up, way up

Let me lick you in places you never been licked before
Take you to places you never been before
Like London, Paris, see that Lamborghini outside
We can share it, J and B without the marriage
Horse and carriage, señorita

Breakfast on the beach, that mean sex is on the beach
You lookin' like a fruit platter, I'ma bite into your peach
And um, I think about to massage your feet
And um, you got a body, you remind of my Jeep
And um, I must look amazing with you
Cause every time you on my arm I got

'Member when you used to curved me, leave my text message unread?
And every time I asked to see you, you say you goin' to bed
Every time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin'
Now you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy
You wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner
Now that's my vagina, she told me to sshh
We in the Chanel store and

Certified with the double-M pullin' up
Tooly got a room, we'll play ""Room Up In Here"", been here
Girl, you know my intentions
I put you on the wall like a picture
Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'
All the lights low, but we lit up
I don't let you down if I get up
Like you got a man, but you're fed up
But you know when we get together

You want me to say your name, huh?

I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti

Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool

""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood

So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Fell in love on Christmas night

I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?

Pop like a Perc, I'm goin' ham
I'm goin' crazy on niggas, too wavy for niggas
Do magic like alakazam
I'm in the kitchen compressin' a birdie
Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty
Then straight to the jeweler, I'm bustin a Rollie
To light up the city like Meechie in '03
I got the plug, he send 'em OT

이 세상 속에 영웅이 된 나
나를 찾는 큰 환호와

All day, everywhere
But 모든 게 너에게 닿기 위함인 걸
내 여정의 답인 걸
널 찾기 위해 노래해
Baby to you

[Verse 6: RM]
전보다 조금 더 커진 키에
좀 더 단단해진 목소리에
모든 건 네게 돌아가기 위해
이제 너라는 지도를 활짝 펼칠게

날 봐 왜 못 알아봐
남들의 아우성 따위 나 듣고 싶지 않아
너의 향기는 여전히 나를 꿰뚫어 무너뜨려
되돌아가자 그때로

Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter

향한 거야

날 위했던 게 아닌 되려 너를 위한 거란 걸
안다면 주저 말고 please save my life
너 없이 헤쳐왔던 사막 위는 목말라
그러니 어서 빨리 날 잡아줘
너 없는 바다는 결국 사막과 같을 거란 걸 알아

Tiny locs and they go crazy
What you know about the dope game?
Was you born in the 80's? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
What you drove through to the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they clothes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix wit my sack for the whole day
Drive-by's, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school play the O'Jays
Tryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage

Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

[Refrain]
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

[Verse 2]
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

[Verse 3]
Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing

Maybe I'm just too demanding

1404,404,404,When I Was Your Man,Chris Jamison,"[Round 1: Arcane]
I said, I was ready to put a stack up
But he had to ask his dad, he needed some backup
Told me his dad wanted to talk to me on the phone and make sure everything add up
I said that shit is sad Charron
You want me to talk to your dad on the phone
When are you gonna lose the chaperone and be a fucking man of your own?
When I was 17 I hustled blocks, had a couple spots
Pounds to my crew
But I never would've rapped outside my bedroom if I sounded like you
When I was 17 I could spit rhymes and freestyle hard
This kid can't even rap and y'all treat him like he's some kind of child star
Well I'ma make him die slow, like poorly prescribed drugs
Or I can make your life short like a .45 snub
Cause little Corey's rhymes suck, so keep your corny lines tucked
Cause we already know how child stars named Corey wind up
But you ain't no Corey Haim
This corny lame is such a groupie I should slap dude
He prolly ain't never even heard of Lost Boys/Boyz, the movie or the rap group
Yo, think about it, think about it
It's been 13 years since Biggie died
And back when that shit happened little Corey wasn't even five
So, now this little fucking preteen virgin soul hurting
His idea of a musical legend is Bo Burnham
Well since you need a history lesson, I'm gon' learn him
After I light up this little glow worm it's closed curtains
See I go hard for the 905, I stay repping that Hammer City
I laugh when you do like this with your hands
That's the same way I be milking your grandma's titties
Mothafucka, I'm a graveyard yet, you ain't even on my radar yet
So I'ma put Charron to sleep in a box, race car bed

[Round 1: Charron]
Yo listen
You said might milking my grandma's titties, well my flowing's legit
You talking about my grandma, well you're older than her bitch
Listen, you brought up Bo Burnham, well he's my boy
That motherfucker is evil
When you heard his song Klu Klux Klan Cookout you're like, ""He said what about my people?""
""You are not black!"" Was always said by his mother
""Arcane, you can't say that word. You're not a brother.""
Now look at you today you stupid fucker
That advice was like the bullet that killed Kurt Cobain
It went in one ear and out the other
Arcane, I met your friends Winston and Ted and that's Ted too
Arcane, you don't have any black friends dude
So where the fuck did you get that accent through?
Yo, he actually thinks he's black, this guy is a wigger
Stop eating Tootsie Rolls with a spork, you won't bite off your fingers
Go ahead and mention I'm young
No one's impressed with this evident scum
You're in your mid thirties and you dress like a thug
You're about as real as the ID I used to get in this club
Someone older than Psycho is something we haven't seen before
I've battled a Korean, you battled in the Korean War
See I should be getting a girlfriend, you should be getting a wife
16 years ago I was in diapers
In 16 years you'll be in diapers for the rest of your life
And your long ass introduction for Knamelis
Organik should've said your time was up
Ironically your intro didn't end til' 3:14, that's pi as fuck!

[Round 2: Arcane]
Son, I run my city like my name was Pops Papalia
I got an Ikea coffee table covered in pot paraphernalia
Since you said I'm 40 son I hope you're not scared of a failure
That means I'm 80 proof, my shit'll put hair on your genitalia
And you can say I'm washed up but I don't really think that's clever cause
Truth is I'm a veteran and you 'bout to be a has been who never was
You went 4 and 0 against bums, but you ain't never battled a vet
So it's time this little overrated faggot got a reality check
Listen, you battled Sandman, JWalker, Lokust and O.Z
So I guess you proved you can hang with the lost tier MC in the whole league
I beat cats like Knamelis, Scandalous, some real fucking OG's
This kid get excused from gym class cause his bitch ass is prone to nose bleeds
Now I know Ottawa got some real MC's
Osa and Bender both grizzly
So how you trying to go international in Grind Time? You ain't even the best in your own city
I heard you ducking Roosevelt cause you in the same age bracket
Okay faggot, you battle in New York with those arms flapping he'd put you in a straight jacket
Now, I understand this, you use those rebuttals as a gimmick
To me that shit's transparent
So everybody look it's King Of The Dot's kid with the flips
This little bitch named Sharon
Well you the type that should never try to rap outside your parent's home
So it's my Basic Instinct to put an ice pick through Sharon's Stone(s)
Now, if this was URL, I'd have to blare the fog horn
Last I seen you, you could barely handle O.Z., it's Sharon Osbourne
Listen, you got molested by Knamelis and Pat Stay
But you were scared of holding his hand
Y'all on some down low Three's Company shit
Sharon, Lois and Bram
First you was Pat Stay's bitch, you call him your ""sugar daddy""
But then when he pimped yo' ass out to Knamelis I guess you took it badly
So I'ma slaughter this geek and please don't bother to speak
You still got a piece of Knamelis pubic hair caught in your teeth
Bitch!

[Round 2: Charron]
Pat Stay wants to rape me, those are the freshest schemes
If Pat Stay was here he'd knock this sucker out for wearing EXCO jeans
You are not black
An intervention was held by his family at his place in the fall
""Alex, you're 30 working at Ikea where they're paying you small
On your breaks you go and hang out with your gang at the mall
And for God will you stop telling people your middle name is 'Jamal'?""
If you're the baddest guy from Hamilton your town is to send
My dad wants the rest of my Cub Scout meetings held there for 2010
And you're from Hamilton? Well I'm a city slayer
After I murder you, your crew and your city mayor
R.I.P. Hamilton, like that Piston's player
When it comes to King Of The Dot, your sister's the biggest groupie
She gave the whole town dome like the plot for the Simpson's movie

[Arcane]
Watch your fucking mouth son!

[Charron]
(Damn. What are you talking about?)
When it comes to girls I'm like GSP
I dominate from the top cause they're out of breath and they're gasping
With girls you're like Dan Hardy cause you'll never end up tapping
See I'm skinny and smart, love pictures of art and I'm sick at guitar
I realize people pick me apart cause they don't think that I'm hard
But Knamelis told me in high school you were picked on and scarred
You were gifted and smart with riveting marks
And ate lunch in the library with the kids that were really bizarre
So I realize I'm a nerd and I just live with the card
So you're battling the person you're afraid to admit that you are

[Round 3: Arcane]
I said yo, son
If all you gon' be spitting, is rehearsed writtens
I hope he brought more than that last weak verse with him
I swear to God you can bring a team of researchers with him
This dude can't even fucking find a t-shirt that fits him
Yo, and you can keep calling me a wigger
But you saying you taking his cash, its like you saying you clapping triggers
Son, you ain't stacking figures, you still playing with action figures
Quit bringing the same lame ass crackers with ya
Cause all of y'all seem like a bunch of rejects from ya high school volleyball team
But yo listen
I know I'm that dude that everybody loves to hate
Yeah, I choked and still won, gave y'all something to debate
Then I came back to clean up ya big brother Jake
So after this, you can tell Pesci I'm coming for the cake
You ain't hip hop ya fake, now you done pissed off at Drake
Antawn Jamison, I might just Chris Bosh ya face
See, cause everything I touch is ether
I should put you in a fucking freezer
You be almost like just like Justin Bieber but you never touched a beaver
Yo, and you ain't never hustled neither
So I don't know what this little guy about
But this some grown man business
I'ma have to put this little kid on timeout

[Round 3: Charron]
Yo, I came to spit flames, I'm here to bust the ether
You compare me to Justin Bieber?
But you have so many ugly features
It looks like as a kid you were beat more than Russell Peters
Yo, and you talk like, ""Yo, I'm Chris Bosh"" basketball when you're making a rhyme
Well I fucked your girl she's the craziest dime
I left her legs more spread open than Lebron James when he's taking a stride
Listen, and you said I stayed at Knamelis's house the last battle you rapped in
Well the night before I stayed at your house I'll tell the people what actually happened
I showed up to his house in a red shirt, he was puzzled and confused
Like, ""Corey, this is Hamilton! You can't wear that the Crips are coming over soon.""
I watched you post up at Zellers from 12:00 to 6:00
With your arms crossed like that and foot on the wall like this
At your house I met your twin brother Mike
I said, ""Wow, you guys are identical, you look exactly alike.""
He said, ""Man, what the fuck do you mean we look exactly alike?""
[?] wrapping salad for supper and rolled out the futon
As soon as you took a bite of it you choked on the croutons
I said, ""Can I get you something to drink? Perhaps a cup of juice?""
He said, ""Man, what the fuck is juice? I want some grape drink baby. Hmmm. Spurt and stuff.""
It was bedtime and he said, ""Boy, you ain't dressed like a rapper.""
He brought me some 2Pac underwear and Exco pajamas
There was no blankets I was cold up on Arcane's sofa
He said, ""Don't use the sheets on my windows. Here's one of my Scarface posters.""
I looked at your Get Rich Or Die Trying wallpaper as I laid on your couch
And said, ""Fuck. This. Shit. I'm going to Knamelis' house.""
Just look at you, Jesus fucking Christ

I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, that's a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and that's confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that car, trick
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got Bape on my back with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she latch on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom? We did it
I see how they counted us out
Bet they never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin', I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I poured up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga, do you really mean it?
When I was sleepin' on the floor, you should see how they treat me
I pour the Actavis, pop pills so I can fight the demons

I did the digital dash
I fucked that bitch in the passenger

These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
If you get hit, you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again, I don’t let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again
And again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I’m Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might gone fit you in on Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that’s making triple what I’m making, what a entrance
That's when you know its a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out, it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past

Like these is all super pretty things that make you feel everything is safe
I got my polo shirt, I got my horse, it's all good
I got my cross on me

[T.I.]
I agree, but I just think that when you have lives lost
As artists, that gives us an obligation to stand up against all of that kinda shit

[Kanye]
You know, me putting the hat on forces an evolution because
There's, even for me, I know so much more in the past 3 days
Because I'm getting this energy, positive or negative
Agreeing with me, disagreeing with me
It's like, and that like sharpens the diamond, that shit
Our mind, our conscienceness the way we're thinking
Just breaking some shit

[T.I.]
Your intentions, from what you tell me, are pure
But the direction that you took to get there is a bit unorthodox
And kind of... I would say - some people would say thoughtless

[Kanye]
If I had not done what I felt and I just thought
Then it would've just never happened
And when I wear that hat it's like a fight for equality
Like ""oh I can wear this hat too""
I think people get mad at me when I name my idols
And I don't say Michael Jordan, I say Disney

[T.I.]
I just want you to consider all the people who just might be terribly, like, just torn apart and hurt

[Kanye]
I really wanna take that hurt off of them and let them understand that I did not wear that hat to hurt them
Half the shit Trump does, I don't agree with

[T.I.]
What half do you agree with?
Let's get that out

Just the ability to do what no one said you could do
To do the impossible is the most inspiring thing to me

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

God damn us, God damn we

Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chastise you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live

1406,406,406,I'm Sorry,Adam Wakefield,"Church

        ""HETTY, Hetty, don't you know church begins at two, and it's gone half after one a'ready? Have you got nothing better to think on this good Sunday as poor old Thias Bede's to be put into the ground, and him drownded i' th' dead o' the night, as it's enough to make one's back run cold, but you must be 'dizening yourself as if there was a wedding i'stid of a funeral?""

        ""Well, Aunt,"" said Hetty, ""I can't be ready so soon as everybody else, when I've got Totty's things to put on. And I'd ever such work to make her stand still.""

        Hetty was coming downstairs, and Mrs. Poyser, in her plain bonnet and shawl, was standing below. If ever a girl looked as if she had been made of roses, that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock. For her hat was trimmed with pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a white ground. There was nothing but pink and white about her, except in her dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser was provoked at herself, for she could hardly keep from smiling, as any mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things. So she turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door, followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she trod on.

        And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon having a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from that promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted by Mrs. Poyser's own hand, setting off the proportions of his leg. Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf. Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face, which was good humour itself as he said, ""Come, Hetty—come, little uns!"" and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway gate into the yard.

        The ""little uns"" addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and seven, in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by rosy cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very small elephant is like a very large one. Hetty walked between them, and behind came patient Molly, whose task it was to carry Totty through the yard and over all the wet places on the road; for Totty, having speedily recovered from her threatened fever, had insisted on going to church to-day, and especially on wearing her red-and-black necklace outside her tippet. And there were many wet places for her to be carried over this afternoon, for there had been heavy showers in the morning, though now the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering silvery masses on the horizon.

        You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the farmyard. The cocks and hens seemed to know it, and made only crooning subdued noises; the very bull-dog looked less savage, as if he would have been satisfied with a smaller bite than usual. The sunshine seemed to call all things to rest and not to labour. It was asleep itself on the moss-grown cow-shed; on the group of white ducks nestling together with their bills tucked under their wings; on the old black sow stretched languidly on the straw, while her largest young one found an excellent spring-bed on his mother's fat ribs; on Alick, the shepherd, in his new smock-frock, taking an uneasy siesta, half-sitting, half-standing on the granary steps. Alick was of opinion that church, like other luxuries, was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who had the weather and the ewes on his mind. ""Church! Nay—I'n gotten summat else to think on,"" was an answer which he often uttered in a tone of bitter significance that silenced further question. I feel sure Alick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his mind was not of a speculative, negative cast, and he would on no account have missed going to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and ""Whissuntide."" But he had a general impression that public worship and religious ceremonies, like other non-productive employments, were intended for people who had leisure.

        ""There's Father a-standing at the yard-gate,"" said Martin Poyser. ""I reckon he wants to watch us down the field. It's wonderful what sight he has, and him turned seventy-five.""

        ""Ah, I often think it's wi' th' old folks as it is wi' the babbies,"" said Mrs. Poyser; ""they're satisfied wi' looking, no matter what they're looking at. It's God A'mighty's way o' quietening 'em, I reckon, afore they go to sleep.""

        Old Martin opened the gate as he saw the family procession approaching, and held it wide open, leaning on his stick—pleased to do this bit of work; for, like all old men whose life has been spent in labour, he liked to feel that he was still useful—that there was a better crop of onions in the garden because he was by at the sowing—and that the cows would be milked the better if he stayed at home on a Sunday afternoon to look on. He always went to church on Sacrament Sundays, but not very regularly at other times; on wet Sundays, or whenever he had a touch of rheumatism, he used to read the three first chapters of Genesis instead.

        ""They'll ha' putten Thias Bede i' the ground afore ye get to the churchyard,"" he said, as his son came up. ""It 'ud ha' been better luck if they'd ha' buried him i' the forenoon when the rain was fallin'; there's no likelihoods of a drop now; an' the moon lies like a boat there, dost see? That's a sure sign o' fair weather—there's a many as is false but that's sure.""

        ""Aye, aye,"" said the son, ""I'm in hopes it'll hold up now.""

        ""Mind what the parson says, mind what the parson says, my lads,"" said Grandfather to the black-eyed youngsters in knee-breeches, conscious of a marble or two in their pockets which they looked forward to handling, a little, secretly, during the sermon.

        ""Dood-bye, Dandad,"" said Totty. ""Me doin' to church. Me dot my neklace on. Dive me a peppermint.""

        Grandad, shaking with laughter at this ""deep little wench,"" slowly transferred his stick to his left hand, which held the gate open, and slowly thrust his finger into the waistcoat pocket on which Totty had fixed her eyes with a confident look of expectation.

        And when they were all gone, the old man leaned on the gate again, watching them across the lane along the Home Close, and through the far gate, till they disappeared behind a bend in the hedge. For the hedgerows in those days shut out one's view, even on the better-managed farms; and this afternoon, the dog-roses were tossing out their pink wreaths, the nightshade was in its yellow and purple glory, the pale honeysuckle grew out of reach, peeping high up out of a holly bush, and over all an ash or a sycamore every now and then threw its shadow across the path.

        There were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside and let them pass: at the gate of the Home Close there was half the dairy of cows standing one behind the other, extremely slow to understand that their large bodies might be in the way; at the far gate there was the mare holding her head over the bars, and beside her the liver-coloured foal with its head towards its mother's flank, apparently still much embarrassed by its own straddling existence. The way lay entirely through Mr. Poyser's own fields till they reached the main road leading to the village, and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops as they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running commentary on them all. The woman who manages a dairy has a large share in making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on stock and their ""keep""—an exercise which strengthens her understanding so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most other subjects.

        ""There's that shorthorned Sally,"" she said, as they entered the Home Close, and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud and looking at her with a sleepy eye. ""I begin to hate the sight o' the cow; and I say now what I said three weeks ago, the sooner we get rid of her the better, for there's that little yallow cow as doesn't give half the milk, and yet I've twice as much butter from her.""

        ""Why, thee't not like the women in general,"" said Mr. Poyser; ""they like the shorthorns, as give such a lot o' milk. There's Chowne's wife wants him to buy no other sort.""

        ""What's it sinnify what Chowne's wife likes? A poor soft thing, wi' no more head-piece nor a sparrow. She'd take a big cullender to strain her lard wi', and then wonder as the scratchin's run through. I've seen enough of her to know as I'll niver take a servant from her house again—all hugger-mugger—and you'd niver know, when you went in, whether it was Monday or Friday, the wash draggin' on to th' end o' the week; and as for her cheese, I know well enough it rose like a loaf in a tin last year. And then she talks o' the weather bein' i' fault, as there's folks 'ud stand on their heads and then say the fault was i' their boots.""

        ""Well, Chowne's been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if thee lik'st,"" said Mr. Poyser, secretly proud of his wife's superior power of putting two and two together; indeed, on recent market-days he had more than once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of shorthorns. ""Aye, them as choose a soft for a wife may's well buy up the shorthorns, for if you get your head stuck in a bog, your legs may's well go after it. Eh! Talk o' legs, there's legs for you,"" Mrs. Poyser continued, as Totty, who had been set down now the road was dry, toddled on in front of her father and mother. ""There's shapes! An' she's got such a long foot, she'll be her father's own child.""

        ""Aye, she'll be welly such a one as Hetty i' ten years' time, on'y she's got THY coloured eyes. I niver remember a blue eye i' my family; my mother had eyes as black as sloes, just like Hetty's.""

        ""The child 'ull be none the worse for having summat as isn't like Hetty. An' I'm none for having her so overpretty. Though for the matter o' that, there's people wi' light hair an' blue eyes as pretty as them wi' black. If Dinah had got a bit o' colour in her cheeks, an' didn't stick that Methodist cap on her head, enough to frighten the cows, folks 'ud think her as pretty as Hetty.""

        ""Nay, nay,"" said Mr. Poyser, with rather a contemptuous emphasis, ""thee dostna know the pints of a woman. The men 'ud niver run after Dinah as they would after Hetty.""

        ""What care I what the men 'ud run after? It's well seen what choice the most of 'em know how to make, by the poor draggle-tails o' wives you see, like bits o' gauze ribbin, good for nothing when the colour's gone.""

        ""Well, well, thee canstna say but what I knowed how to make a choice when I married thee,"" said Mr. Poyser, who usually settled little conjugal disputes by a compliment of this sort; ""and thee wast twice as buxom as Dinah ten year ago.""

        ""I niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good missis of a house. There's Chowne's wife ugly enough to turn the milk an' save the rennet, but she'll niver save nothing any other way. But as for Dinah, poor child, she's niver likely to be buxom as long as she'll make her dinner o' cake and water, for the sake o' giving to them as want. She provoked me past bearing sometimes; and, as I told her, she went clean again' the Scriptur', for that says, 'Love your neighbour as yourself'; 'but,' I said, 'if you loved your neighbour no better nor you do yourself, Dinah, it's little enough you'd do for him. You'd be thinking he might do well enough on a half-empty stomach.' Eh, I wonder where she is this blessed Sunday! Sitting by that sick woman, I daresay, as she'd set her heart on going to all of a sudden.""

        ""Ah, it was a pity she should take such megrims into her head, when she might ha' stayed wi' us all summer, and eaten twice as much as she wanted, and it 'ud niver ha' been missed. She made no odds in th' house at all, for she sat as still at her sewing as a bird on the nest, and was uncommon nimble at running to fetch anything. If Hetty gets married, theed'st like to ha' Dinah wi' thee constant.""

        ""It's no use thinking o' that,"" said Mrs. Poyser. ""You might as well beckon to the flying swallow as ask Dinah to come an' live here comfortable, like other folks. If anything could turn her, I should ha' turned her, for I've talked to her for a hour on end, and scolded her too; for she's my own sister's child, and it behoves me to do what I can for her. But eh, poor thing, as soon as she'd said us 'good-bye' an' got into the cart, an' looked back at me with her pale face, as is welly like her Aunt Judith come back from heaven, I begun to be frightened to think o' the set-downs I'd given her; for it comes over you sometimes as if she'd a way o' knowing the rights o' things more nor other folks have. But I'll niver give in as that's cause she's a Methodist, no more nor a white calf's white cause it eats out o' the same bucket wi' a black un.""

        ""Nay,"" said Mr. Poyser, with as near an approach to a snarl as his good-nature would allow; ""I'm no opinion o' the Methodists. It's on'y tradesfolks as turn Methodists; you nuver knew a farmer bitten wi' them maggots. There's maybe a workman now an' then, as isn't overclever at's work, takes to preachin' an' that, like Seth Bede. But you see Adam, as has got one o' the best head-pieces hereabout, knows better; he's a good Churchman, else I'd never encourage him for a sweetheart for Hetty.""

        ""Why, goodness me,"" said Mrs. Poyser, who had looked back while her husband was speaking, ""look where Molly is with them lads! They're the field's length behind us. How COULD you let 'em do so, Hetty? Anybody might as well set a pictur' to watch the children as you. Run back and tell 'em to come on.""

        Mr. and Mrs. Poyser were now at the end of the second field, so they set Totty on the top of one of the large stones forming the true Loamshire stile, and awaited the loiterers Totty observing with complacency, ""Dey naughty, naughty boys—me dood.""

        The fact was that this Sunday walk through the fields was fraught with great excitement to Marty and Tommy, who saw a perpetual drama going on in the hedgerows, and could no more refrain from stopping and peeping than if they had been a couple of spaniels or terriers. Marty was quite sure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while he was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior Tommy. Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not be got to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her ready sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and said ""Lawks!"" whenever she was expected to wonder.

        Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called to them that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first, shouting, ""We've found the speckled turkey's nest, Mother!"" with the instinctive confidence that people who bring good news are never in fault.

        ""Ah,"" said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this pleasant surprise, ""that's a good lad; why, where is it?""

        ""Down in ever such a hole, under the hedge. I saw it first, looking after the greenfinch, and she sat on th' nest.""

        ""You didn't frighten her, I hope,"" said the mother, ""else she'll forsake it.""

        ""No, I went away as still as still, and whispered to Molly—didn't I, Molly?""

        ""Well, well, now come on,"" said Mrs. Poyser, ""and walk before Father and Mother, and take your little sister by the hand. We must go straight on now. Good boys don't look after the birds of a Sunday.""

        ""But, Mother,"" said Marty, ""you said you'd give half-a-crown to find the speckled turkey's nest. Mayn't I have the half-crown put into my money-box?""

        ""We'll see about that, my lad, if you walk along now, like a good boy.""

        The father and mother exchanged a significant glance of amusement at their eldest-born's acuteness; but on Tommy's round face there was a cloud.

        ""Mother,"" he said, half-crying, ""Marty's got ever so much more money in his box nor I've got in mine.""

        ""Munny, me want half-a-toun in my bots,"" said Totty.

        ""Hush, hush, hush,"" said Mrs. Poyser, ""did ever anybody hear such naughty children? Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes any more, if they don't make haste and go on to church.""

        This dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles, alias ""bullheads,"" which the lads looked at wistfully.

        The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was not a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but no temptation would have induced him to carry on any field-work, however early in the morning, on a Sunday; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a pair of oxen ""sweltered"" while he was ploughing on Good Friday? That was a demonstration that work on sacred days was a wicked thing; and with wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite clear that he would have nothing to do, since money got by such means would never prosper.

        ""It a'most makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines so,"" he observed, as they passed through the ""Big Meadow."" ""But it's poor foolishness to think o' saving by going against your conscience. There's that Jim Wakefield, as they used to call 'Gentleman Wakefield,' used to do the same of a Sunday as o' weekdays, and took no heed to right or wrong, as if there was nayther God nor devil. An' what's he come to? Why, I saw him myself last market-day a-carrying a basket wi' oranges in't.""

        ""Ah, to be sure,"" said Mrs. Poyser, emphatically, ""you make but a poor trap to catch luck if you go and bait it wi' wickedness. The money as is got so's like to burn holes i' your pocket. I'd niver wish us to leave our lads a sixpence but what was got i' the rightful way. And as for the weather, there's One above makes it, and we must put up wi't: it's nothing of a plague to what the wenches are.""

        Notwithstanding the interruption in their walk, the excellent habit which Mrs. Poyser's clock had of taking time by the forelock had secured their arrival at the village while it was still a quarter to two, though almost every one who meant to go to church was already within the churchyard gates. Those who stayed at home were chiefly mothers, like Timothy's Bess, who stood at her own door nursing her baby and feeling as women feel in that position—that nothing else can be expected of them.

        It was not entirely to see Thias Bede's funeral that the people were standing about the churchyard so long before service began; that was their common practice. The women, indeed, usually entered the church at once, and the farmers' wives talked in an undertone to each other, over the tall pews, about their illnesses and the total failure of doctor's stuff, recommending dandelion-tea, and other home-made specifics, as far preferable—about the servants, and their growing exorbitance as to wages, whereas the quality of their services declined from year to year, and there was no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you could see her—about the bad price Mr. Dingall, the Treddleston grocer, was giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as to his solvency, notwithstanding that Mrs. Dingall was a sensible woman, and they were all sorry for HER, for she had very good kin. Meantime the men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the singers, who had a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through, entered the church until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature entrance—what could they do in church if they were there before service began?—and they did not conceive that any power in the universe could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about ""bus'ness.""

        Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry at him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at once as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with which the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the farmers; for Chad was accustomed to say that a working-man must hold a candle to a personage understood to be as black as he was himself on weekdays; by which evil-sounding rule of conduct he meant what was, after all, rather virtuous than otherwise, namely, that men who had horses to be shod must be treated with respect. Chad and the rougher sort of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the white thorn, where the burial was going forward; but Sandy Jim, and several of the farm-labourers, made a group round it, and stood with their hats off, as fellow-mourners with the mother and sons. Others held a midway position, sometimes watching the group at the grave, sometimes listening to the conversation of the farmers, who stood in a knot near the church door, and were now joined by Martin Poyser, while his family passed into the church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson, the landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking attitude—that is to say, with the forefinger of his right hand thrust between the buttons of his waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches pocket, and his head very much on one side; looking, on the whole, like an actor who has only a mono-syllabic part entrusted to him, but feels sure that the audience discern his fitness for the leading business; curiously in contrast with old Jonathan Burge, who held his hands behind him and leaned forward, coughing asthmatically, with an inward scorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash. The talk was in rather a lower tone than usual to-day, hushed a little by the sound of Mr. Irwine's voice reading the final prayers of the burial-service. They had all had their word of pity for poor Thias, but now they had got upon the nearer subject of their own grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who played the part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr. Donnithorne himself, for that gentleman had the meanness to receive his own rents and make bargains about his own timber. This subject of conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door. And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased, and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church.

        They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine passed. Adam and Seth were coming next, with their mother between them; for Joshua Rann officiated as head sexton as well as clerk, and was not yet ready to follow the rector into the vestry. But there was a pause before the three mourners came on: Lisbeth had turned round to look again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth under the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any day since her husband's death. Along with all her grief there was mixed an unusual sense of her own importance in having a ""burial,"" and in Mr. Irwine's reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods of their fellow-parishioners.

        The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of Mr. Donnithorne's carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste.

        But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth; the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every one must now enter and take his place.

        I cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was remarkable for anything except for the grey age of its oaken pews—great square pews mostly, ranged on each side of a narrow aisle. It was free, indeed, from the modern blemish of galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to themselves in the middle of the right-hand row, so that it was a short process for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass, and return to his desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk, grey and old as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into the chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the buff-washed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior, and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats. And there were liberal touches of crimson toward the chancel, for the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew had handsome crimson cloth cushions; and, to close the vista, there was a crimson altar-cloth, embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia's own hand.

        But even without the crimson cloth, the effect must have been warm and cheering when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking benignly round on that simple congregation—on the hardy old men, with bent knees and shoulders, perhaps, but with vigour left for much hedge-clipping and thatching; on the tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of the stone-cutters and carpenters; on the half-dozen well-to-do farmers, with their apple-cheeked families; and on the clean old women, mostly farm-labourers' wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under their black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow, folded passively over their chests. For none of the old people held books—why should they? Not one of them could read. But they knew a few ""good words"" by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and bring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing up—the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey pews, while good Bishop Ken's evening hymn was being sung to one of those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in his usual place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent too—all the more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his bass notes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of severity into the glances he sent over his spectacles at the recusant Will Maskery.

        I beseech you to imagine Mr. Irwine looking round on this scene, in his ample white surplice that became him so well, with his powdered hair thrown back, his rich brown complexion, and his finely cut nostril and upper lip; for there was a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen countenance as there is in all human faces from which a generous soul beams out. And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through the old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue, that threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall.

        I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his family. And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white figure. But Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances—she was absorbed in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church, for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate by this time. She had never seen him since she parted with him in the wood on Thursday evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things had gone on just the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that had happened then had brought no changes after them; they were already like a dream. When she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat so, she dared not look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she curtsied herself. That must be old Mr. Donnithorne—he always came first, the wrinkled small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia was passing, and though Hetty liked so much to look at her fashionable little coal-scuttle bonnet, with the wreath of small roses round it, she didn't mind it to-day. But there were no more curtsies—no, he was not come; she felt sure there was nothing else passing the pew door but the house-keeper's black bonnet and the lady's maid's beautiful straw hat that had once been Miss Lydia's, and then the powdered heads of the butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet she would look now—she might be mistaken—for, after all, she had not looked. So she lifted up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the chancel—there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged prayer-book. The chill disappointment was too hard to bear. She felt herself turning pale, her lips trembling; she was ready to cry. Oh, what SHOULD she do? Everybody would know the reason; they would know she was crying because Arthur was not there. And Mr. Craig, with the wonderful hothouse plant in his button-hole, was staring at her, she knew. It was dreadfully long before the General Confession began, so that she could kneel down. Two great drops WOULD fall then, but no one saw them except good-natured Molly, for her aunt and uncle knelt with their backs towards her. Molly, unable to imagine any cause for tears in church except faintness, of which she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew out of her pocket a queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after much labour in pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against Hetty's nostrils. ""It donna smell,"" she whispered, thinking this was a great advantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good without biting your nose. Hetty pushed it away peevishly; but this little flash of temper did what the salts could not have done—it roused her to wipe away the traces of her tears, and try with all her might not to shed any more. Hetty had a certain strength in her vain little nature: she would have borne anything rather than be laughed at, or pointed at with any other feeling than admiration; she would have pressed her own nails into her tender flesh rather than people should know a secret she did not want them to know.

        What fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings, while Mr. Irwine was pronouncing the solemn ""Absolution"" in her deaf ears, and through all the tones of petition that followed! Anger lay very close to disappointment, and soon won the victory over the conjectures her small ingenuity could devise to account for Arthur's absence on the supposition that he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her again. And by the time she rose from her knees mechanically, because all the rest were rising, the colour had returned to her cheeks even with a heightened glow, for she was framing little indignant speeches to herself, saying she hated Arthur for giving her this pain—she would like him to suffer too. Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so, as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees.

        But Adam's thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our moments of keen sensibility. And to Adam the church service was the best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to discern odours.

        But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village nooks in the kingdom—a reason of which I am sure you have not the slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses. The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance, like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the wind among the autumn boughs. This may seem a strange mode of speaking about the reading of a parish clerk—a man in rusty spectacles, with stubbly hair, a large occiput, and a prominent crown. But that is Nature's way: she will allow a gentleman of splendid physiognomy and poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune, and not give him the slightest hint of it; and takes care that some narrow-browed fellow, trolling a ballad in the corner of a pot-house, shall be as true to his intervals as a bird.

        Joshua himself was less proud of his reading than of his singing, and it was always with a sense of heightened importance that he passed from the desk to the choir. Still more to-day: it was a special occasion, for an old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death—not in his bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant—and now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure. Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua's importance in the choir suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang. The old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them, and the words—

                                Thou sweep'st us off as with a flood;
                                We vanish hence like dreams—

        seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor Thias. The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings. Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good; it was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a greater wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy days while he was living. The more there was said about her husband, the more there was done for him, surely the safer he would be. It was poor Lisbeth's blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of faith in some other love. Seth, who was easily touched, shed tears, and tried to recall, as he had done continually since his father's death, all that he had heard of the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last might be a moment of pardon and reconcilement; for was it not written in the very psalm they were singing that the Divine dealings were not measured and circumscribed by time? Adam had never been unable to join in a psalm before. He had known plenty of trouble and vexation since he had been a lad, but this was the first sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and strangely enough it was sorrow because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation was for ever gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his father's hand before their parting, and say, ""Father, you know it was all right between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!"" Adam thought but little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man's feelings had been in moments of humiliation, when he had held down his head before the rebukes of his son. When our indignation is borne in submissive silence, we are apt to feel twinges of doubt afterwards as to our own generosity, if not justice; how much more when the object of our anger has gone into everlasting silence, and we have seen his face for the last time in the meekness of death!

        ""Ah! I was always too hard,"" Adam said to himself. ""It's a sore fault in me as I'm so hot and out o' patience with people when they do wrong, and my heart gets shut up against 'em, so as I can't bring myself to forgive 'em. I see clear enough there's more pride nor love in my soul, for I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th' hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind word to him. And there went plenty o' pride and temper to the strokes, as the devil WILL be having his finger in what we call our duties as well as our sins. Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was easiest for myself. It's allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still, but the real tough job for me 'ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against my own pride. It seems to me now, if I was to find Father at home to-night, I should behave different; but there's no knowing—perhaps nothing 'ud be a lesson to us if it didn't come too late. It's well we should feel as life's a reckoning we can't make twice over; there's no real making amends in this world, any more nor you can mend a wrong subtraction by doing your addition right.""

        This was the key-note to which Adam's thoughts had perpetually returned since his father's death, and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger emphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference to Thias's funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, ""In the midst of life we are in death""—how the present moment is all we can call our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family tenderness. All very old truths—but what we thought the oldest truth becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men want to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light, do they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we may measure its intensity by remembering the former dimness?

        Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime words, ""The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,"" seemed to blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the bonnets of the little maidens who had slept through the sermon, the fathers collecting the prayer-books, until all streamed out through the old archway into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk, their simple civilities, and their invitations to tea; for on a Sunday every one was ready to receive a guest—it was the day when all must be in their best clothes and their best humour.

        Mr. and Mrs. Poyser paused a minute at the church gate: they were waiting for Adam to come up, not being contented to go away without saying a kind word to the widow and her sons.

        ""Well, Mrs. Bede,"" said Mrs. Poyser, as they walked on together, ""you must keep up your heart; husbands and wives must be content when they've lived to rear their children and see one another's hair grey.""

        ""Aye, aye,"" said Mr. Poyser; ""they wonna have long to wait for one another then, anyhow. And ye've got two o' the strapping'st sons i' th' country; and well you may, for I remember poor Thias as fine a broad-shouldered fellow as need to be; and as for you, Mrs. Bede, why you're straighter i' the back nor half the young women now.""

        ""Eh,"" said Lisbeth, ""it's poor luck for the platter to wear well when it's broke i' two. The sooner I'm laid under the thorn the better. I'm no good to nobody now.""

        Adam never took notice of his mother's little unjust plaints; but Seth said, ""Nay, Mother, thee mustna say so. Thy sons 'ull never get another mother.""

        ""That's true, lad, that's true,"" said Mr. Poyser; ""and it's wrong on us to give way to grief, Mrs. Bede; for it's like the children cryin' when the fathers and mothers take things from 'em. There's One above knows better nor us.""

        ""Ah,"" said Mrs. Poyser, ""an' it's poor work allays settin' the dead above the livin'. We shall all on us be dead some time, I reckon—it 'ud be better if folks 'ud make much on us beforehand, i'stid o' beginnin' when we're gone. It's but little good you'll do a-watering the last year's crop.""

        ""Well, Adam,"" said Mr. Poyser, feeling that his wife's words were, as usual, rather incisive than soothing, and that it would be well to change the subject, ""you'll come and see us again now, I hope. I hanna had a talk with you this long while, and the missis here wants you to see what can be done with her best spinning-wheel, for it's got broke, and it'll be a nice job to mend it—there'll want a bit o' turning. You'll come as soon as you can now, will you?""

        Mr. Poyser paused and looked round while he was speaking, as if to see where Hetty was; for the children were running on before. Hetty was not without a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about her than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white hot-house plant, with a very long name—a Scotch name, she supposed, since people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression on Hetty's face as she listened to the gardener's small talk. Yet in her secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information would be given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was very fond of giving information.

        Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were received coldly, for to shift one's point of view beyond certain limits is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble understanding—it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover, Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty that the ""lass was well enough,"" and that ""a man might do worse""; but on convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.

        Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who ""knew his business"" and who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he was less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said in confidence to her husband, ""You're mighty fond o' Craig, but for my part, I think he's welly like a cock as thinks the sun's rose o' purpose to hear him crow."" For the rest, Mr. Craig was an estimable gardener, and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of himself. He had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung his head forward a little, as he walked along with his hands in his breeches pockets. I think it was his pedigree only that had the advantage of being Scotch, and not his ""bringing up""; for except that he had a stronger burr in his accent, his speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people about him. But a gardener is Scotch, as a French teacher is Parisian.

        ""Well, Mr. Poyser,"" he said, before the good slow farmer had time to speak, ""ye'll not be carrying your hay to-morrow, I'm thinking. The glass sticks at 'change,' and ye may rely upo' my word as we'll ha' more downfall afore twenty-four hours is past. Ye see that darkish-blue cloud there upo' the 'rizon—ye know what I mean by the 'rizon, where the land and sky seems to meet?""

        ""Aye, aye, I see the cloud,"" said Mr. Poyser, ""'rizon or no 'rizon. It's right o'er Mike Holdsworth's fallow, and a foul fallow it is.""

        ""Well, you mark my words, as that cloud 'ull spread o'er the sky pretty nigh as quick as you'd spread a tarpaulin over one o' your hay-ricks. It's a great thing to ha' studied the look o' the clouds. Lord bless you! Th' met'orological almanecks can learn me nothing, but there's a pretty sight o' things I could let THEM up to, if they'd just come to me. And how are you, Mrs. Poyser?—thinking o' getherin' the red currants soon, I reckon. You'd a deal better gether 'em afore they're o'erripe, wi' such weather as we've got to look forward to. How do ye do, Mistress Bede?"" Mr. Craig continued, without a pause, nodding by the way to Adam and Seth. ""I hope y' enjoyed them spinach and gooseberries as I sent Chester with th' other day. If ye want vegetables while ye're in trouble, ye know where to come to. It's well known I'm not giving other folks' things away, for when I've supplied the house, the garden s my own spekilation, and it isna every man th' old squire could get as 'ud be equil to the undertaking, let alone asking whether he'd be willing I've got to run my calkilation fine, I can tell you, to make sure o' getting back the money as I pay the squire. I should like to see some o' them fellows as make the almanecks looking as far before their noses as I've got to do every year as comes.""

        ""They look pretty fur, though,"" said Mr. Poyser, turning his head on one side and speaking in rather a subdued reverential tone. ""Why, what could come truer nor that pictur o' the cock wi' the big spurs, as has got its head knocked down wi' th' anchor, an' th' firin', an' the ships behind? Why, that pictur was made afore Christmas, and yit it's come as true as th' Bible. Why, th' cock's France, an' th' anchor's Nelson—an' they told us that beforehand.""

        ""Pee—ee-eh!"" said Mr. Craig. ""A man doesna want to see fur to know as th' English 'ull beat the French. Why, I know upo' good authority as it's a big Frenchman as reaches five foot high, an' they live upo' spoon-meat mostly. I knew a man as his father had a particular knowledge o' the French. I should like to know what them grasshoppers are to do against such fine fellows as our young Captain Arthur. Why, it 'ud astonish a Frenchman only to look at him; his arm's thicker nor a Frenchman's body, I'll be bound, for they pinch theirsells in wi' stays; and it's easy enough, for they've got nothing i' their insides.""

        ""Where IS the captain, as he wasna at church to-day?"" said Adam. ""I was talking to him o' Friday, and he said nothing about his going away.""

        ""Oh, he's only gone to Eagledale for a bit o' fishing; I reckon he'll be back again afore many days are o'er, for he's to be at all th' arranging and preparing o' things for the comin' o' age o' the 30th o' July. But he's fond o' getting away for a bit, now and then. Him and th' old squire fit one another like frost and flowers.""

        Mr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation, but the subject was not developed farther, for now they had reached the turning in the road where Adam and his companions must say ""good-bye."" The gardener, too, would have had to turn off in the same direction if he had not accepted Mr. Poyser's invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly seconded the invitation, for she would have held it a deep disgrace not to make her neighbours welcome to her house: personal likes and dislikes must not interfere with that sacred custom. Moreover, Mr. Craig had always been full of civilities to the family at the Hall Farm, and Mrs. Poyser was scrupulous in declaring that she had ""nothing to say again' him, on'y it was a pity he couldna be hatched o'er again, an' hatched different.""

        So Adam and Seth, with their mother between them, wound their way down to the valley and up again to the old house, where a saddened memory had taken the place of a long, long anxiety—where Adam would never have to ask again as he entered, ""Where's Father?""

        And the other family party, with Mr. Craig for company, went back to the pleasant bright house-place at the Hall Farm—all with quiet minds, except Hetty, who knew now where Arthur was gone, but was only the more puzzled and uneasy. For it appeared that his absence was quite voluntary; he need not have gone—he would not have gone if he had wanted to see her. She had a sickening sense that no lot could ever be pleasant to her again if her Thursday night's vision was not to be fulfilled; and in this moment of chill, bare, wintry disappointment and doubt, she looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again, of meeting his loving glance, and hearing his soft words with that eager yearning which one may call the ""growing pain"" of passion.",208720,1,0.627,0.469,0.456,0,0.109,-4.612,0.0285,139.833,0.252

I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got twelve slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way

One of dem ones—right

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?""
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk of the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t how it always seems when it’s so together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust

Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened (lately)
Lately, it’s all contradiction
Lately, I’m not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours

Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in, if it's okay
She said, ""It's okay.""",307880,3,0.193,0.678,0.562,0,0.104,-9.197,0.508,94.241,0.566

[Verse 1]
It's in the air
The way you smile when you reciprocate my stare
Just one breath and everyone knows that you're there
With every hit I take, you move that waist and I wanna die
A girl like you, adore
The way you drop that thing could start another war
And my hands are gettin' eager to explore
Cherry lips are singin' ""Purple Rain"" and I feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
I take the wheel and grab the clutch
Your body should be mine to touch
I fit the rhythm your body's givin'
And once I get in there

[Chorus]
She got the smoothest ride
Like velvet all inside
Her sex just changed my life
She rides like a dream
And damn that velvet looks good on me

[Verse 2]
I feel the heat
Every drop of you is rainin' down on me
You're perfection's foggin' up my window seat
I got your body switchin' all positions through the night

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

It's tearing up my voice, left in silence

Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget

Reminding me, I got these scars, to forget your love
Keep reminding me, oh, to forget your love

Yeah, I got some niggas that still owe me an apology
I'ma be the bigger man just like I always be
Eventually but right now that's hard for me
I'm dreaming violent, I can't tolerate disloyalty
So I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane
But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily ""Why you not with me?""
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big, I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now
I had to learn, I never had shit
You never would split, you was hood rich
I couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)

At least I was good to you

[Verse]
I can't make no fucking promises
Lifestyle getting out of control, lifestyle getting ludicrous
I made a milli' in less than a year and I blew that on stupid shit
Typed it in like, ""How to make a milli'"" I used to google it
Savannah just wanted to see me perform
And got hit over stupid shit
I woke up and saw the shit right on my phone
They don't know who the shooter is
You never know, never feel untouchable
I touched your soul, made you feel so comfortable
If I let you go, I would feel so skeptical
Unacceptable but I still gotta let you know
Yeah, that I can't make no fucking promises
I can't make no fucking promises, I can't make no fucking promises
Yeah, lifestyle on the road, sheesh
Used to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek
Yeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's
I had to be on that corner until it was morning
So me and my niggas could eat
I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet
I got my foot in the door
They never gave me the key, I had to turn to a ki
Even when I was a boy
I was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat
I was a beast, sheesh
He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me
Damn, but she can't keep no fucking promises
Shit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit
Told Mo, ""Bring the studio to everywhere we go"" and that's a lotta hits
Slo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit
Something 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations
Whole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless
Can't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit
Have you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit
I went from rags to riches
I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face
I hit the baddest bitches
It's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day
I treated them bad
I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way
So treat me the same way, same way, same way
I was a savage to you
I had to give up and put all my hoes to the side
I swear if I ever left you in the cold
It's cause it was colder inside
Look here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone
I hope you don't turn to a thot
Most of the niggas that call me only hit my phone
Because I get money a lot
I be the one with the throne
You say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie
Even before we was on
The money was long and we used to fuck up the spot
Bitches was singing my song
I knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch
Niggas was hating before and they hate on me now
But don't know what to say to me now
I was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her
Keep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?
Even if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her
Even if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you

You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them

Three’s not a crowd all up in it, slow fire

Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' Jay
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (look)

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lackin' with it, ""he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up!""—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (pew)—Gabby Giffords
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a f*****, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (ha), sorry if I took forever (haha)

Don't fall on my fate (it's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (haha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to
Everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (woo!)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall… bitch! (yeah)

Ooh, wasted love

[Verse 1]
So I'm not supposed to love you no more
I guess I'm not supposed to care
I held you so close, now I'm holding a ghost
How can love just disappear?
And where does it go when it's over?
I know that it's somewhere out here

[Chorus 1]
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die trying to justify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?

[Verse 2]
It's late, I'm drunk and I'm running on empty tonight
Baby, I'm chasing my shadow around
Like smoke cigarettes I inhale these regrets
I can't change what I've become
There's pain and there's glory, but this is my story
I'm asking everyone
Knocking down doors and I'm pounding the pavement
Lie at your mercy, will somebody save me? Save me?

[Chorus 2]
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die let me testify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
Knocking down doors and I'm pounding the pavement
Lie at your mercy, will somebody save me? Save me?
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die let me testify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?

Ten times out of nine, I know you‘re lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down

But ten times out of nine, I'm only human

I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day

People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see

I ain't perfect, won't deny

So I'm working on a better me

Come and kick a deal on some rich shit
I'ma keep it pimpin' on some rich shit
We can do the show on the jet lift
Fuckin' in the air on the jet, bitch
We can do the helicopter cruisin' over Vegas
Hundred thousand dollars for a watch, count fetti
Kiss on a nigga with his chains on, glizzy
Fuck so good, got both of us dizzy
Do it lowkey, profile, get busy
Do it lowkey, profile, gettin' busy
Got the Audemars Piguet on fleek
Got my number one freak in the sheets

[Verse 2]
Let's stop for a while, have recess
Let's stop for a while, have recess
Let's kiss for a while, have recess
Let's touch for a while, have recess
Do it for a while like a replay
Let me see you wind that ass up like a DJ
Run that back like a DJ
I know you see this big face
Chandelier froze for a bad one
Come and kick game in your ear while I smash you
And I keep them thangs in my ear while I'm stabbin'
And I catch you hot like the flame and the passion
And I got the flash on deck, no battery
And I have some Tom Fords on while you suckin' me
Cuban link hang off my neck, to your nip from my neck
To my watch and my chain, it's gon' drizzle, gon' drizzle

[Chorus]
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Make a little love , have rich sex (yeah, yeah)

Baby girl, let's have some rich sex (Come on)

Tryin' to get control
Pressure’s takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn’t love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion

[Verse 2]
I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn’t love, it wasn’t love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)

Where are you?
Cause I can’t see you
It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Where are you?
Cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
But I feel you watchin’ me
Illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Where were you
Cause I can't see
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Mistaken for love
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy

I'm over the show
Yeah at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion
You were a perfect illusion
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, illusion (illusion)

I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening

Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now

I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now

Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch, I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real, I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that

Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

They're singing ""Closing Time"" at that little bar across the street

And through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighbor’s cigarette cough
There's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did

Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it

Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place

No, don't be scared that I’m gon’ tie ya down
I need a little more

[Chorus]
Baby don't call me your friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
But if you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye
Give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title
Better give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title

[Verse 2]
If it ain't no thang
I won't be hanging around (hanging around)
But don't blow up my shit at 3 AM saying how you need me now
Don't call me boo
Like you're some kind of ghost (well, you're a ghost)
If you don't want me seeing other guys
Well, here’s what you need to know

[Chorus]
Baby don't call me your friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find

Give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title
Better give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title

[Bridge]
Yo, said I'm a special kind of woman
I'm loving what you got, but I'm hating what you doing
Ya gotta understand that I’m looking for a man who can get up on a bike, look ma, no hands
You gotta show me off, off
But if you embarrassed, if that’s the case I'm all gone
You gotta treat me like a trophy, put me on the shelf
Or call me something else

[Chorus]
Baby don't call me your friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
But if you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye
Give me that title, title

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't get no better, can’t get no more cheddar
I feel like a king and my queen is Coretta
I been made a livin', I'm never gon’ give in
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that I’m fallin’
The world think I'm ballin’ and maybe I am
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am
Or who I’m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might
Got 'em all in my sight
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am
I know I'm the man
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security
Everyone deal with they own insecurity
Even the preacher was born with impurity
Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow
Hope my anxiety stay on the low
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow
Where do I go? What would you do
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?
What would you do if you did it all?
If you ain't never have to lift a finger
Would you linger like, ""Fuck 'em all""?
Guess that's your call, but I can't
This a marathon, not a sprint
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint
Can you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?

[Chorus]
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know

[Interlude]
How I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)
Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)
Down, roll it up, yeah

[Verse 2]
Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits
Only led me to battle depression
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain
What if your life was under a glass?
And people tried to dig up shit from your past
And tell you what's good and what's not
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'
Fuck social media
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap
They always compare, they always compare me to others
And try to hit me up against all my brothers
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?
(Overdosin' at the crib)
'Cause people just won't let 'em live
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside
And they wonder why we all hide, shit
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate
Sit in the corner and think of a better day
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away
I just cannot seem to think of a better way
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)
'Cause ""you'll never be Kenny""
""You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole""
""You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old,"" yeah
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound
And play it when nobody else is around
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground
God, give me the power to battle depression
Yeah, round after round
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am
Do what you love and do not give a damn
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram
Just mind your own business and be a good man
Be a good boss and be a good friend
Spread your imagination to the millions
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions
Just spread that positivity for the children
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em
Know somebody feel 'em
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourself

They care more about how much I leave 'em
Where’d I leave it?
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You’re a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won't hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me
That only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes
It's now or next
Can't lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin’, that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is
As it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here
Why am I here?
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string
I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real
The shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill
Lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns
I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tag, no mistake, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive. Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive""
I don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious
'Cause if we could buy time every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Refrain]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question
I ask the reader
God bless the reader

What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out for something new, that means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it and let me guide you to the purple rain

If you know what I'm singing about up here
Come on, raise your hand
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you
Only want to see you in the purple rain

Bless up, she tell me I'm a god, get on her knees for confession
Sent a vid to her nigga, had to teach a lesson
Me and Boat only want bad hoes in our section
Juice, why these pussy ass niggas always pressin'?
I don't know, let 'em talk, I'ma go get my Smith & Wesson
Blessed boys under 21, steady flexin'

Lamborghini dreams, but you still drive a Lexus
I'm a young king, I might fuck Alexis Texas
But I ain't on no Drake shit, I won't get her pregnant
Damn, young Juice WRLD, boy, you reckless
And I feel you, until I get her naked
When I get up in it, I might have to stay in
Well if she goin' like that, let's run a train then
Fuck, I think I nutted in her, I might need a playpen
And a stroller
How I get this deep? We rode her like a Rover
No games, but I XBOX control her
She do the gang like a nerd doin' homework
.40 in my pants, that bitch thought it was a boner
If I go broke, I'ma juug off Motorolas
But now I'm up in France, Lil Boat, that's my mans
We get the green and then we fly around like Peter Pan
That's cool, but I just thought 'bout somethin', wait

Ayy, somebody grab him some clippers (Zzzzt)
His fuckin' beard is weird
Tough talk from a rapper payin' millions for security a year
""I think my dad's gone crazy,"" yeah, Hailie, you right
Dad's always mad cooped up in the studio, yellin' at the mic
You're sober and bored, huh? (I know)
'Bout to be 46 years old, dog
Talkin' 'bout ""I'ma call up Trick Trick""
Man, you sound like a bitch, bitch
Man up and handle your shit (Ugh)
Mad about somethin' I said in 2012
Took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss (Huh)
Homie we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive
Fuckin' dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside
Fuck ""Rap God,"" I'm the Rap Devil
Comin' bare-faced with a black shovel
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it (Ayy!)

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about the fact you actually blackballed a rapper
That's twice as young as you (Let's talk about it)
Let's call Sway
Ask why I can't go on Shade 45 because of you (Brrt)
Let's ask Interscope
How you had Paul Rosenberg tryin' to shelf me (Huh?)
Still can't cover up the fact
Your last four albums is as bad as your selfie
Now tell me, what do you stand for? (What?)
I know you can't stand yourself (No)
Tryin' to be the old you so bad, you Stan yourself (Ha)
Let's leave all the beefin' to 50 (Please)
Em, you're pushin' 50
Why you claimin' that I'ma call Puff?
When you the one that called Diddy (Facts)
Then you went and called Jimmy (Facts)
They conference called me in the morning (What?)
They told me you mad about a tweet
You wanted me to say sorry (What?)
I swear to God I ain't believe him (Nah)
Please say it ain't so (No)
The big bad bully of the rap game can't take a fuckin' joke
Oh, you want some fuckin' smoke (What?)
But not literally, you'll choke
Yeah, I'll acknowledge you're the G.O.A.T
But I'm The Gunner, bitch, I got you in the scope (Brra!)
Don't have a heart attack now (No)
Somebody help your mans up (Help!)
Knees weak of old age, The Real Slim Shady can't stand up!

You should go back to Recovery (Wouh)
I know your ego is hurtin'
Just knowin' that all of your fans discovered me (Hi!)
He like, ""Damn, he a younger me
Except he dresses better and I'm ugly
Always making fun of me.""
Stop all the thuggery, Marshall, you livin' in luxury (Ayy)
Look what you done to me
Dropped an album just because of me
Damn, you in love with me!
You got money but I'm hungry
I like the diss but you won't say them lyrics out in front of me
Shout out to every rapper that's up under me
Know that I'll never do you like this fuckery
Still bitter after everyone loves you
Pull that wedgie out your dungarees (Ayy)
I gotta respect the OGs and I know most of 'em personally (Ayy!)
But you're just a bully actin' like a baby
So I gotta read you a nursery (Nursery)
I'm the ghost of the future
And you're just Ebenezer Scrooge (Facts)

I ain't know it would be you

Never hesitate to say it to your face, I'm a asshole
Bitch-ass motherfucker

Fuck Kells!

[Verse 4]
We know you get nervous, Rabbit
I see Mama's spaghetti all over your sweater
I wish you would lose yourself on the records
That you made a decade ago, they were better
Accordin' to them, you're a national treasure
To me, you're as soft as a feather
The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number
Just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
""I'm not afraid,"" okay Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (Fuck)
You got an Oscar, damn
Can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time
It's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology
Over the simple fact, you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy
How could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8"" and I'm 6'4"", seven punches hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy
I was named after a gangster (Brr!)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you! (Thank you!)
I just wanna feed my daughter
You tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action
Text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my fuckin' self, what's happenin'
EST captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me
When he realizes there ain't shit he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah there's a difference between us
I got all of my shit without Dre producin' me (Ayy!)
I know you're not used to me
Usually one of your disses should ruin me
But bitch I'm from Cleveland
Everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (Shh!)
Dropped an album called Kamikaze
So that means he killed him
Already fucked one rapper's girl this week
Don't make me call Kim!

Feels like a close, it’s coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Couplet 1 : Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ‘’Hi! My Name Is’’ dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I’ve been against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn’t amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don’t wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin’, it’s your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I’ve already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…

[Refrain : Sia]
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn’t wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, the time is here
Guts over fear, I shall not tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Guts over fear, guts over fear

[Pont : Eminem]
Feels like a close, it’s coming to

It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Couplet 2 : Eminem]
It’s like I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn’t until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck""
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I’ve caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in the trailer park?
And the window that was closing and there’s nowhere else I can go with flows in
And I’m frozen cause there’s no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I’d rather make “Not Afraid 2” than making another mothafuckin’ “We Made You” uh
Now I don’t wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can’t explain to y’all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my damn self
But on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all’s they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I’m gone
And to think I was... gone

I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as momma's hands
Running water, standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label
Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must’ve missed the come up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes

All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

One night
When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach

I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?
My occupation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had change
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, ""blaow, blaow!"", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, ""Don't forget me""
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through

I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was

It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time
And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world

Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced

Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins

I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?

If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house

My baby's got a smile on her face, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
As soon as I get to work I call her on the phone
I wanna tell her that I love her, I can't wait til I get home
She doesn't say a word when I walk in
Looks like we might not get much sleep again

[Chorus]
Cause my baby's got a smile on her face
My baby's got a smile on her face

[Bridge]
Every time we get together
My baby's got a smile on her face
Yeah, I wanna make it last forever
My baby's got a smile on her (you're gonna take it easy)

[Outro]
Just look at her, gotta look at her
Take a look at that smile on her face",197213,5,0.0515,0.414,0.826,0.000173,0.254,-3.566,0.0372,166.055,0.76

We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away, oh
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way

[Verse 2]
Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

[Verse 3]
And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no

Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty
Wandering around this midnight mad house city
You got a look that says you've got it all together
So if you don't mind, I'd like to know you better

[Chorus]
Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

[Verse 2]
I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in Clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive

[Chorus]
Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

[Bridge]
Didn't think tonight when I walked in
I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been

[Chorus]
Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want your red blushing stories
Your faults and your glories
That made you who you are right now
Take me the long way around
Take me the long way around",208720,10,0.265,0.488,0.637,0,0.106,-7.63,0.0401,88.865,0.23

Dear Hate
I saw you on the news today
Like a shock that takes my breath away
You fall like rain, cover us in drops of pain
I'm afraid that we just might drown

[Verse 2]
Dear Hate
Well, you sure are colorblind
Your kiss is the cruelest kind
You could poison any mind
Just look at mine
Don't know how this world keeps spinning 'round and 'round

[Chorus]
You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

[Verse 3 - Vince Gill]
Dear Hate
You were smiling from that Selma bridge
In Dallas, when that bullet hit and Jackie cried
You pulled those towers from the sky
But even on our darkest nights
The world keeps spinning 'round

[Chorus]
You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

[Bridge]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Coda]
Dear Love
Just when I think you've given up
You were there in the garden when I ran from your voice
I hear you every morning through the chaos and the noise
You still whisper down through history and echo through these halls
And tell me love's gonna conquer all
Gonna conquer all",220387,9,0.804,0.526,0.412,0,0.117,-9.292,0.0385,79.732,0.289

She sees them walking in a straight line, that's not really her style
And they all got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world could ever bring them down
Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the background
And she says...

I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids

[Verse 2]
He sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue
Yeah, they're living the good life, can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where they're going
In the fast lane, living life without knowing
And he says...

[Hook]
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
