I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part

Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I’ll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (lo-love me harder)

Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain
And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time

[Chorus: Ariana Grande, The Weeknd]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', ""Everybody's famous!""
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both

There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?

Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

That never got the chance to touch the sea

Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense

When your eyes look back
When you're standing in the moment

Makes you dance, makes you fall

Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

[Verse 1]
My friends had you figured out
Yeah they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah it's still burning

'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you

But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

[Verse 2]
Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
'Cause I love living innocent
Oh, you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learned

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you

I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick (brr brr)
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch

Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watchin' way more than the garden grow

'Cause shawty you thinkin’ them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?

I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club

Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 3: Macklemore & Kesha]
Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

You don't know what you've got

43,43,43,Bad Things,Machine Gun Kelly x Camila Cabello,"CABELLO KICKED OFF HER SOLO CAREER AND HER BAND SISTERS IN FIFTH HARMONY UNEXPECTEDLY DENOUNCED HER FOR IT. NOW SHE’S GOT A TOP FIVE SINGLE, A MUCH-ANTICIPATED ALBUM COMING AND ZERO SECOND THOUGHTS: “YOU HAVE TO HONOR THAT INNER VOICE”.

CAMILA CABELLO IS LATE FOR BRUNCH. But not sullen, rock-star, hiding-behind-shades late. More like 19-year-old, mixed-up-the-address late. She’s running through the dining room of Versailles, a Cuban restaurant deep in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, lush black hair streaming, apologies pouring forth, having just rushed from the other Versailles, in the city’s center.

As soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning, flashing that disarmingly broad smile, the singer — who was born in Cuba, resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town — says, “I’ve got you on what we’re going to eat.” She then proceeds to order, in rapid-fire Spanish, a bounty of food: lemonades, steaks, rice, beans, plantains, croquettes, flan.

Confusion, stress, the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabello’s recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony, the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child, with more than 7 million digital songs sold, according to Nielsen Music.

Before the year was out, she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely, that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty).

But that’s the confusion and stress. During that same time, Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer, who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time, released the darkly sexy rap-romp single “Bad Things” with Machine Gun Kelly last October, and it climbed the charts. (It’s now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And that’s not even her first hit: “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes, peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.

She has social numbers to rival the band’s (3.4 million to 5H’s 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram), a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems, in retrospect, like an inevitable transition to solo stardom.

“It would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world,” says her friend Mendes, adding, “She was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.”

But Cabello, whose album is due this fall, already had fame, fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift, after five years of nonstop touring, recording and meet-and-greets with 5H, is the taste of freedom.

“You know that quote, ‘In the silence, you find God?’ ” asks Cabello, who — in her lace choker, a holey white tee and a black marching band coat — looks like the petite (she’s 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. “I felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.”

The heart, of course, can be an unreliable guide, and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans — who easily overrun fan polls, like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards’ 2016 Song of the Summer contest, in which “Work From Home” crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake — are not to be underestimated.)

Only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career, and she’s not an ordinary human: She’s Beyoncé.

The closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to, as it seems all young female pop stars must, thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle.

Zayn Malik disavowed his past, graffitied his home, cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album, all of which only made him cooler.

Niall Horan took a backpacking trip, rediscovered the ’70s folk-rock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour, which just made him dreamier.

Harry Styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note.

Cabello, lest she be judged, must be seductive but pure of heart, strong but vulnerable, self-possessed but not selfish. In a way, girl-group rules still apply.

But that hasn’t stopped her from building on her momentum, and not just by hitting the studio and bringing “Bad Things” to The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Machine Gun Kelly in January (her first post-5H TV appearance, a month after Fifth Harmony’s final televised performance).

She has also carefully cultivated her public voice, telling Lena Dunham in a Lenny interview before Donald Trump’s inauguration: “I’m going to stick up for immigrants, and I’m going to stick up for Hispanic people and their rights.”

After Trump issued his immigration order, she tweeted, “the #MuslimBan is dehumanizing beyond words... im in shock. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.”

“The easiest route would be to shut my mouth, sing the songs, wear the clothes and keep going, you know?” says Cabello with a jittery laugh, weighing life in 5H against going it alone.

“I mean, [we were] at the peak of our career. It’s definitely not the safe option.” But, she says, “I have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me, it has always been: Don’t settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down.” She flings her arms like she’s on a roller coaster. “I feel alive!”

The lyrics analysis site Genius recently determined that Cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in Fifth Harmony’s songs. Even when she was doing the most inside the group, Cabello was doing the most outside it, too. She started writing on her own early in 5H’s career, despite the grueling schedule.

Her friend Taylor Swift’s Red inspired her to make “sonic photographs” of her changing life, so when she wasn’t cutting parts for 5H’s 2013 Better Together EP at Hollywood’s Record Plant, she would be in the studio’s gym, writing lyrics over other artists’ melodies about things like “my first kiss and my first boyfriend.” Then she got GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard, and began churning out “shitty demos” while touring malls and, in time, arenas.

“I would wake up super early,” says Cabello, “get off the bus, go to the hotel, put the TV on super loud — I didn’t want people to hear me f—ing yelling — then go into the bathroom, put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day.”

So she was basically singing into the toilet?

“Yep.”

“She has done her 10,000 hours,” says Cabello’s manager Roger Gold, co-founder of 300 Entertainment. “Fifth Harmony worked incredibly hard 11-and-a-half months of the year. It was an incredible school.”

But when it finally came time for Cabello to go solo, bitter, previously unhinted-at feelings erupted in a shockingly public way.

When I ask her about it, Cabello doesn’t shy away from discussing the drama of late December 2016, although she clearly means to take the high road:

*When did the relationship between you and the group start to change?*

I don’t know. I was always super open [that] I couldn’t just sing other people’s words and be totally happy with that. You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.

*Do you feel like that changed the relationship, your asserting that?*

I think that in a group there is always going to be tension, whether it’s because of this thing or [another] thing. Obviously, I think that rocked the boat.

*Have you been in touch with anyone in 5H since all that went down?*

No.

*Have you reached out directly?*
I did, yeah. I don’t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it’s hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad.

*When I first heard you were going solo, I was like, “I’m sure there are no hard feelings because this isn’t a surprise.” Then I was like, “What’s happening?”*

I had the same reaction. I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them.

Cabello took her first vacation in five years on Christmas, after her mother, Sinuhe, insisted she unplug with the family (including her dad, Alejandro, and 9-year-old sister, Sofia) for three weeks in Cancún.

“The first four days were trippy,” says Cabello. “I was stressing about not stressing about something. Sometimes you’re afraid of the quiet. Like, go, go, go!”

Cabello was raised in Havana and, later, Mexico City. When she was 6, her folks told her they were going to Disney World. Instead, Camila and Sinu (as she’s called) emigrated legally from Mexico, spent a day in holding, took a 36-hour bus ride to Miami and moved in with a friend.

Alejandro was forced to stay behind, but after a year-and-a-half of heartache, he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over. Sinu was an architect in Cuba but found work at a Marshalls, stocking shoes. Alejandro, when he arrived, washed cars at the mall. Today, they have a successful contracting company.

“My parents worked really hard,” says Cabello. “We always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money, losing everything and then finding a way to get it again. If we had food to eat, a roof over our heads and I was going to school, that was enough.”

(Alejandro finally got his visa in 2016, and Cabello sent her parents to Jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had.)

Cabello’s Florida friends, who all predate her appearance on The X Factor, reconnected for “Friendsgiving” in 2016 and FaceTimed an eighth-grade theater teacher who encouraged Cabello when she first got into acting and singing.

She’s not much for going out: “I had a phase in Miami where I was like, ‘I’m going to do all the things I would do if I were 19,’ ” which she is. “I went [to clubs], and I was like, ‘I don’t love this.’ ”

After our brunch in Los Angeles, she plans to meet Troye Sivan for coffee and then have him and Swift over to her Silver Lake Airbnb for some “chill stuff.”

Mainly, Cabello’s focused on making music.

Even her hobbies serve the cause. For song ideas she mines poetry (the book Milk and Honey, by young feminist Rupi Kaur, made her cry), novels (currently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez), movies (her favorites include The Notebook, Titanic, Romeo + Juliet and, above all, the 2001 rom-com Serendipity) and inspirational quotes she finds on Tumblr.

She also enjoys practicing guitar — 5H player and “super close friend” Ashlee Juno gave her daily lessons on the group’s 7/27 Tour in 2016.

Romantically speaking, says Cabello, “I don’t have anything going on right now,” although she does let slip that “literally every boy I’ve liked has been a Scorpio.” (Rumormongers, take note: Mendes is a Leo.)

And when we start talking about La La Land, she winds up telling an unbelievable story:

“I love the movie because I’m such a hopeless romantic. It made me feel like I could meet anybody anywhere. Like, yesterday I asked my Uber driver for his number. Because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like, ‘I just came out of a relationship.’ He just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic. And I was like, ‘You know what? I’ll get his number.’ He never texted me back.” What? “I don’t know. Maybe it didn’t go through.”

A few weeks after our brunch, in early February, Cabello’s in the booth at Sphere Studios in Los Angeles, laptop out and Notes app open, singing from a file called “It’s Only Natural” using her achiest coo and a slight patois: “It’s only natural, I need some love from you/I might pull up on you/It’s only human to, wanna do da tings we do.” The vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and Jack Ü-style edited vocal samples.

“I never underestimated her talent, but I was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision,” says Andrew “Pop” Wansel, who’s known for his work with Kehlani and Alessia Cara, from the control room.

“It’s a real collaboration,” chimes in co-producer Frank Dukes, who has worked with Drake and Travis Scott. “Sometimes it’s like a band just jamming.”

The trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend Cabello’s love for Rihanna’s ANTI (“I can loop it forever,” she says), the era of R&B-pop that includes Alicia Keys’ 2007 song “No One,” all things Shakira and, of course, Cuban music.

They want to open the LP with a dusty, piano-clanging cut called “Havana” and preview an upbeat Caribbean heater that sounds like Sia planting a flag in “One Dance.”

“Camila is an incredible songwriter,” says Epic Records chairman/CEO Antonio “L.A.” Reid, who (with Simon Cowell) assembled 5H for The X Factor and still has Cabello on his roster. “She is working overtime.”

Cabello’s mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes. Sinu isn’t a momager so much as her daughter’s right hand and confidante.

Along with the other members of 5H, she has been by Cabello’s side the entire time, and now she’s the only one left who has seen it all. Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, is soldiering on without Cabello.

Epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017, too, and 5H’s People’s Choice Awards performance of “Work From Home” in January was an unmistakable shoulder-brush, as Fifth Harmony changed the “I” to “We” in Cabello’s opening line, “I ain’t worried about nothing,” and punctuated it with a full stop.

“I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ If I’m growing as an artist, that’s success.”

In April 2016, I interviewed the members of Fifth Harmony for a Billboard cover story, and the chat quickly turned into a tear-drenched airing of grievances about the group’s toll on their private lives. The only one who didn’t cry was Cabello.

“I was like, ‘Oh, my God, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.’ I’m sorry about that,” she tells me this time around.

Cabello wasn’t immune to the pressures, just on the mend, fighting anxiety with journaling, exercise, meditation and music. I remind her what she told me then — that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her.

“It’s so hard to hear that,” says Cabello, lowering her head. “It breaks my heart. It’s like I’m watching myself from another person’s perspective, like, ‘Damn, poor girl.’ ”

She did finally cry after the turmoil with the group, in Miami with her parents and sister. And then, she says, “I went to the beach a lot. I listened only to Latin music. It reminds me of where I come from and that this [conflict] doesn’t have to be World War III. In Cuba, people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks, throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity. That’s real shit. Not this.

“I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ ” continues Cabello. “To me, if I’m in the studio every day and I’m growing as an artist and I’m speaking from my heart, that’s success. The results don’t matter. I mean, isn’t that the goal?”

If Cabello is anxious now, it doesn’t show. She seems proud of what 5H was — “We represented all different kinds of women coming together,” she says fondly — but is candid about what it wasn’t:

“We didn’t write our records. We were interpreting somebody else’s story. Fifth Harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us, and I don’t think anybody felt individually represented by the sound — we didn’t make it.”",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye

And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I’ll always be around
You push my love away like it’s some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run

And I gave you my best and we both know you can’t say that
You can’t say that

We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would’ve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' ""dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt

Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, ""Make it quick if the Lord take me""
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, ""sell dope, rap or go to NBA""
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living

No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing

That I'm gonna make it out alive

And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one

[Pre-Chorus]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

[Chorus]
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

[Post-Chorus]
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

[Verse 2]
And I will stay up through the night
Yeah, let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doin' everythin' I can
And another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

[Pre-Chorus]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

[Chorus]
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got thick skin and an elastic heart

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a ""Yes, sir,"" not a follower

Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Sunday morning man
She woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station

If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane

With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks

[Verso 1: Maluma]
Cuando estás bien te alejas de mí
Te sientes sola y siempre estoy ahí
Es una guerra de toma y dame
Pues dame de eso que tienes ahí
Oye, baby, no seas mala
No me dejes con las ganas
Se escucha en la calle
Que ya no me quieres
Ven y dímelo en la cara

[Pre-Coro: Shakira, Maluma]
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo un egoísta

[Coro: Ambos, Shakira, Maluma]
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quiera
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie

[Verso 2: Maluma, Shakira]
Como tú me tientas, cuando tú te mueves
Esos movimientos sexys, siempre me entretienen
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas
No sé porque me tienes en lista de espera
Te dicen por ahí que voy haciendo y deshaciendo
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ahí sufriendo
Que en esta relación soy yo la que manda
No pares bola' a toda esa mala propaganda

[Puente: Maluma, Shakira]
Pa', pa' que te digo na', te comen el oído
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido
Y como un loco sigo tras de ti, muriendo por ti
Dime qué hay pa' mí, bebé (¿Qué?)

Pregúntale a quien tú quieras

May we all get to grow up in a red, white, and blue little town
Get a won't-start, hand-me-down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
'Cause you miss it too much

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes

In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though

Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight

Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out

Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—

I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

So, what can I say except ""you're welcome""?
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome
I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome, you're welcome

[Verse 3]
Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly, I can go on and on
I can explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway
And the tapestry here in my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been, I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tippity tapping
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey

[Chorus]
Well anyway, let me say ""you're welcome""
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go
Hey, it's your day to say ""you're welcome""
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome
'Cause Maui can do everything but float
You're welcome, you're welcome

I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life

Will find it hard to sleep tonight

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutions
She tells me ""worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

Hola mi amor, vengo acompañado
DY
Nicky, Nicky, Nicky Jam
Let me holla at you for a second

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Uno de nosotros es de barrio fino
Un tipo muy real (The Big Boss)
Nos jugó una apuesta, que ni te miremos
Que te va a robar (Tamo' ready)
El otro es medio loco, con veinte tatuajes
Y ese swing de calle (Dimelo papi)
Y en su Lamborghini, con labia salvaje
Quiere impresionarte
El tercero es un poeta, trae serenatas
Brilla como el sol (Sólo escucha)
El chico de las poesías
Atentamente, tu servidor

[Coro: Romeo Santos, Daddy Yankee]
Bella y sensual, sobrenatural
Uno de nosotros te tiene que conquistar
Bella y sensual, sobrenatural
Uno de nosotros te tiene que conquistar

[Verso 2: Nicky Jam]
Quiero ser dueño de tu cama, ah
Tratarte como una dama, ah
Los tres tenemos la fama, ah
Pero a mí nadie me gana, escúchame
Romeo te habla bonito y Yankee tiene a Yamilette
Yo te hago travesuras, mami hasta el amanecer
Tengo lo que hace falta para hacerte enloquecer
Por eso te pregunto si quieres ser mi mujer
¿Con quién te vas? Tengo la curiosidad
Dime si soy yo, dame la oportunidad
Yo seré un loquito pero puedo amarte
Dime mamacita, porque quiero llevarte

[Coro: Romeo Santos, Nicky Jam]
Bella y sensual, sobrenatural
Uno de nosotros te tiene que conquistar (Zumba Nicky, Come on!)
Bella y sensual, sobrenatural
Uno de nosotros te tiene que conquistar (You know who's this baby)

[Verso 3: Daddy Yankee]
(Da-ddy!)
Si tú dejas que te invite, te doy lo que necesite
Tenemos algo en común y es que conmigo nadie compite
Me gusta que tienes pique, no te me desubiques
Si quieres una película, mami, yo tengo los tickets
Si estás enfermita te doy mi Robitussin
Conviértete en mi rusa, ponteme media Putin
Nicky vuela como un fénix y Romeo, el bachata king
Pero sigo siendo el mejor libra por libra en el ring
Baby, yo sé que está difícil la decisión
Reconoce que aquí no hay liga, yo soy tu opción
Yo sé que seras mía-ía
Cuando tiro no falla mi puntería-ía
Soy el mejor de esta trilogía
Pero quien tú escojas, te ganas la lotería

Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still

Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday

Many priests, the good things in there
Change all conditions in Heaven yes, Ae Ae

You are every night I want to slowly slowly taste
My equality, how much love how to put it
I have only one angle
You seem to have ears, you feel my words
You can spend a long time in a very short time

You, you are a mechanic and made of iron
See how

Simply pulse acceleration (Yes)
If you are interested in more than money
My mind is all necessary
I killed without problems

I want to get rid of your throat
I will show you something in your ear
If you are not with me you will lose

I would, I wish, I want to know down the fullness of I love art
I am in a hurry, I want to go
First of all, surprise

But here I am on the mountain oh yeah

Maldición, amor o lujuria

Dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
No hay nadie, nadie que me supere

Si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
Si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
Mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme
Mantenlo al cien: no te tengo, no tengo nada

[Verso 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ayy, tengo algo
Espera, nosotros funcionamos sin suposiciones
Me siento como Tyson con eso
Golpéalo dos veces, estoy con eso
Solo por la noche, estoy bromeando
Solo por la vida, sí, solo por la vida, sí
Solo por la vida, sí, consigamoslo
Golpea ese hombro delgado
Sé lo que significa
De espalda a altamar
Sé lo que necesitas
Ya en diez, todo el dinero entra
Todo sentimiento sale, este sentimiento no se seca
Esta fiesta no terminará

No quiero presionarte
Quiero tu bendición hoy (ámame)
Oh, por cierto, abre la puerta por el camino
Te dije que estoy en camino (ámame)
Estoy en camino, sé que la conexión es vaga
Levanta el teléfono para mí, bebé
Maldición, interferimos
La mala actitud de tu abuela
Las curvas y caderas de tu abuela
Recuerda Gardena, tomé la cámara de estudio
Sé que Top estará enojado conmigo

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Well, I got some Coke in my bourbon
Surfin' the room like Swazye
No, I ain't drunk, I'm amazin'
Yeah, I got that laid way, way back, back in my swagger

Don't start rainin' on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute

Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

[Verse 2]
Guess you don't know what you want
'Til you see 'em movin' on
Making lonely look like freedom
Baby, don't even act like I'm doing something wrong
If my song comes on and I get lost on that dance floor
In somebody's arms that ain't yours

My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words

Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else

I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (true)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, ohh

Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

I met this girl late last year
She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (you bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (you bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love

Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you, I love you

Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me

How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

Pero todavía sigo derribando puertas cerradas de las bisagras

Ah, und du hast von mir gehört
Oh, ich habe große Feinde (yeah)
Großer Ruf, großer Ruf
Oh, du und ich würden ein großes Gesprächsthema sein (git git)
Ah, und ich habe von dir gehört (yeah)
Oh, du magst die Bösen auch

[Strophe 1: Future]
Du bist so cool, übertreibe nicht, ich bin so aufgeregt, ich brauche einen Drink
Wir tuen das meiste, ich bin im Geist, wie ich ein Boot auspeitsche
Ich habe einen Ruf, Mädchen, welcher mir nicht vorgeht (yah)
Ich bin einen Anruf entfernt, wann immer du mich brauchst (yah)
Ich bin in einem G5 (yeah), komme zu der A-Seite (yeah)
Ich habe eine „bad boy"" Rolle, das ist was sie mögen (was sie mögen)
Du liebst es, ich liebe es auch, denn du bist mein Typ (du mein Typ)
Du hälst mich fest und ich und ich beschütze dich mit meinem Leben

[Pre-Refrain: Taylor Swift & Future]
Ich will dich nicht ausbessern, ich will nicht sein
Nur ein weiterer Ex-Liebhaber, den du nicht sehen willst
Ich will dich nicht vermissen (ich will dich nicht vermissen)
Wie die anderen Mädchen es tuen
Ich will dich nicht verletzen, ich will einfach nur
Am Strand trinken mit dir ganz auf mir
Ich weiß, was sie alle sagen (ich weiß, was sie alle sagen)
Aber ich versuch' nicht zu spielen

[Refrain: Taylor Swift]
Ich will dein Ziel sein (Ziel)
Ich will deine Nummer eins sein (Nummer eins)
Ich will dein A-Team sein (A-Team)
Ich will dein Ziel sein, Ziel

[Strophe 2: Ed Sheeran]
Jetzt gut, als ich jung wahr, wir verbunden uns
Als wir etwas älter waren, beide sprangen
Ich habe Probleme und Geld auf meinen beiden Schultern
Der Ruf geht mir vor und Gerüchte sind Knietief
Die Wahrheit ist, es ist einfacher es zu ignorieren, glaub mir
Selbst wenn wir Streiten würden, würden wir es nicht lange tuen
Und du verstehst, das Gute und das Schlechte enden in einem Song
Für alle deine wundervollen Eigenschaften und die Art, es mit Leichtigkeit zu tun
Für alle meine Fehler, Paranoia und Unsicherheiten
Ich habe Fehler gemacht und machen Entscheidungen getroffen, welche schwer zu verleugnen sind
Nach dem Sturm, etwas ist geboren am 4. Juli
Ich habe Tage ohne Spaß verbracht, dieses Ziel ist das letzte
Mit 4 Wörtern auf der Spitze meine Zunge, die ich niemals sagen werde

[Pre-Refrain: Taylor Swift]
Ich will dich nicht ausbessern, ich will nicht sein
Nur ein weiterer Ex-Liebhaber, den du nicht sehen willst
Ich will dich nicht vermissen (ich will dich nicht vermissen)
Wie die anderen Mädchen es tuen
Ich will dich nicht verletzen, ich will einfach nur
Am Strand trinken mit dir ganz auf mir
Ich weiß was sie sich erzählen
Aber ich versuch' nicht zu spielen

[Refrain: Taylor Swift]
Ich will dein Ziel sein (Ziel)
Ich will deine Nummer eins sein (Nummer eins)
Ich will dein A-Team sein (A-Team)
Ich will dein Ziel sein, Ziel

[Post-Refrain: Taylor Swift & Future]
Großer Ruf, großer Ruf
Oh, du und ich, wir haben einen großen Ruf
Ah, und du hast von mir gehört
Oh, ich habe einige große Feinde
Hey, großer Ruf, großer Ruf
Oh, du und ich würden ein großes Gesprächsthema sein
Ah, und ich habe von dir gehört
Oh, du magst die Bösen auch

[Strophe 3: Taylor Swift]
Ich traf dich mit einem BANG, wir haben versucht es zu vergessen, aber wir konnten es einfach nicht
Und ich begrabe Beile, aber ich behalte Karten von wo ich sie hintue
Der Ruf geht mir vor , sie erzählen dir ich bin verrückt
Ich schwöre, ich liebe das Drama nicht, es liebt mich
Und ich kann dich nicht loslassen, deine Handabdrücke auf meiner Seele
Es ist als sind deine Augen alkoholische Getränke, es ist als ist dein Körper Gold
Du hast mich gezwungen Farbe zu erkenne über alle meine üblichen Tricks
So hier ist eine Wahrheit vom meinen roten Lippen

[Refrain: Taylor Swift, Future & Ed Sheeran]
Ich will dein Ziel sei (Ziel)
Ich will deine Nummer eins sein (du und ich, Nummer eins)
Ich will dein A-Team sein (dein A-Team sein, A-Team)
Ich will dein Ziel sein, Ziel
Ich will dein Ziel sein (oh, ich will)
Ich will deine Nummer eins sein (Nummer eins)
Ich will dein A-Team sein (A-Team)
Ich will dein Ziel sein, Ziel",244827,2,0.00845,0.649,0.589,0,0.108,-6.237,0.0558,159.073,0.151

No I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie, she said we should be together

If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

224,224,224,Five More Minutes,Scotty McCreery,"[Verse 1]
Eight years old a couple cane poles sitting down by the creek
Our lines in the water watching those bobbers seeing that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling ""Supper's hot, y'all come and get it!""
We yelled five more minutes
At sixteen it was twelve o three standing at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight, but we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off, interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes

[Verse 2]
At eighteen, turned my helmet in, and walked to the fifty yard line
It's just the coach and me after we lost state ten to nine
And I cried, ""man next time to get in here, I'll have to buy a ticket""
Can't you give me five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes

[Bridge]
At eighty-six my grandpa said there's angels in the room
With all the family gathered 'round we knew that time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed Lord I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah sometimes this old life will leave you wishing
That you had five more minutes
Oh five more minutes",238954,7,0.325,0.517,0.652,0,0.109,-6.153,0.0323,156.07,0.333

Épico
Salte 'el medio, ¿okay?
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh, eh (Suénalo)
Me dijeron que te acabas de dejar (Eh)
Que el bobo aquel te engañó
Que ya no crees en el amor (No)
Que andas suelta igual que yo (Bad-Bunny)
No sé, pero (Huh), la noche está pa’ desquitarno' (Ey, ey)
Otro shot vamo' a darno’ (Mujeres, get ready, sube)
Que yo también quiero joder, vacilar (¿Qué, qué, qué?)
Trae a to'a tus amiga' que yo las voy a poner a fumar
Dale hasta abajo, pata-bajo sin parar, yeh

[Coro: Lunay, Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Porque estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Rra, rra)
'Tar soltera está de moda
Por eso no va a cambiar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Estar soltera está de moda (¿Qué, qué, qué?)
Por eso ella no se enamora (Dile; ¡No!)
Estar soltera está de moda (D-D-D.Y.)
Por eso no va a cambiar (¡Da-ddy Yan-kee!)

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Ella 'tá soltera (Wuh, wuh), con su' amiga' revuelta'
Va pa’ la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta’ (Prr)
'Tá soltera (Fuego), con su’ amiga' revuelta'
Va pa' la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta’ (Fue')

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
Ella vacila y vive en la joda
No 'tá lista pa' un trajecito blanco en la boda
Puede perriar con uno, como sea, lo baila sola (She-she-she)
Batea pa' .500, siempre bota la bola (¿Cómo?)
Pon-Ponme a prueba a ver, que to' el peso te va a caer
La orden de cateo, las mano' contra la pare'
Pa' darle pal' piso no pide permiso (No; ¡wuh!)
Si está soltera, sin compromiso (¿Qué, qué?)
'Tá pa' la rumba y hacer dinero y yo que soy un bandolero
Me gustan como tú
Las que no creen en sentimiento' ni un 14 de febrero
(D-D-D.Y.)

[Pre-Coro: Lunay]
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar
Solita pa' romper la disco
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (She-she-she)
Dale hasta abajo, pata-abajo sin parar

Y estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (¡Ble!)

Por eso no va a cambiar

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny, Daddy Yankee]
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
Se cansó de lo' embuste' y a su vida le hizo un ajuste, ey (Prr)
Si la ves en la disco con botella', no te asuste'
Puesta pa'l problema, así que no la busquen
Déjala volar como decía Tito (Hu-huh)
Ese culo, al traje le queda chiquito (Ah)
La leona no está puesta pa' gatito' (No), ey
Y sin ti, le va bonito
Hoy se siente coqueta (¿Qué, qué?)
Siempre activa, nunca quieta
To'a las moña' son violeta'
El corazón lo tiene a dieta, ey
Pa' que ningún cabrón se meta (Sube, sube, sube, sube)
Te dejó en read otra ve'
Te ha picha'o to'a las llamada' y to' lo' text
¿Tú no entiende' que hace rato dijo ""next""?
La nena está haciendo más ticket que el ex, eh (¡Chin'-ching!)

[Verso 3: Lunay, Daddy Yankee]
Ponte-Ponte pa' la vuelta, que yo voy pa'l party (Lunay, dile)
Si no, nos vemo', mami, en el after party
Ponte pa'l problema, ándale, déjate ver
Lo que aquí empezamo', lo matamo' en el motel (Fue'-fuego)
Tú estás suelta por ahí, yo estoy suelto por acá
Hacerte wiki-wiki, como dice Yaviah
Soltó el corazón, sacó a pasear la maldá'
(Tiene la mente dañá')

Go hard when the going's tough

Knock us down, we'll get back up again and again

Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Nigga)
New magic, new magic, new magic wand

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave)

Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)
You wanna be mean, mixed signals, don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door

She'd be a single-barrelled Bourbon on ice
Smooth with a kick
A chill and a burn all at the same time

[Pre-Chorus]
She's Sunday drive meets
High speed chase
She ain't just a song
She's the whole mixtape
She's so complicated
That's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane


[Chorus]
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
She don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

[Verse 2]
I know how to make her laugh
Or blush, or mad at me
But that's okay there ain't no one more beautiful angry

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And she loves just as deep
As she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows
Can't have one without the other
And I love her just the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane

And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this

But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

To seeing shows in evening clothes with you

To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you

When we're becoming something else

Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long (All night long)

But I never would've had a doubt
If I'd have known where I'd be now

Oh, I could do this for a lifetime

The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit

Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change

I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain

Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now

There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day...

And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

Find a seat right next to mine

For something, whoa oh oh oh

Roll away a pickup line
Now and then they check your phone
Catch mine and let 'em go
From the little bit I've seen
They're the perfect shade of green
Next time they come my way
Heaven help me, make 'em stay

We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing

Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae

She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith

If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)

Du nahmst mein Herz auf der Zunge als Dekoration
Du hast meine Liebe für dich mit einer Stiftung verwechselt

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, no oh-oh-oh-oh
Said I'm all about it

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I'm not a rapper just a singer with a game plan
I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand
80,000 people in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming ""Who want what?""
Now, please be warned
That every song I feature on has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type
Now I'm in the limelight
Tryna get my mind right
Body clock is in the clouds so often guess it's high time
Hoodie sing the line like

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
I'm not a singer, I just rap pretty
So now my fan base is full of Megan's and Ashley's
And they're wondering if there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like, ""Naturally, baby, let me find a spot in the front""
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, we can pretend
Oh, typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to Paula my patent
The young prince of Manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien Broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and Revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is Yeezus

[Bridge]
One for the money
Two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold and now everybody is winning
I'm Larry David plus Miles Davis
So, everybody hating and fuck it, I hardly blame 'em

Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby

Diga pra esses arrombado ficar só no, ""Desejo, desejo""
Todas essas vadias parecendo frias, mas todas essas vadias
São que nem varas de peixe
Coloque uma fita na minha vagina porque minha buceta é bem dotada
Eu não tenho tempo livre, toda minhas coisas são caras
Veja meu anel, meu relógio
Minha corrente e tá tudo brilhando (Gelo)
Todo esse ouro em mim, eu me sinto que nem o Slick Rick
Se eles me amam ou me odeiam, não faz diferença (Cardi)
É difícil não matar uma putiane, por isso eu tô me segurando

[Verso 1: Cardi B]
Agora eu vou estar contando dinheiro, comprando joias, e as putiane  cavalgando no pau (Pau)
Eu apenas conto o meu dinheiro e cuido da minha vida, as putiane vão estar em cima de um pau (Pau)
""Eu posso ver Cardi ganhando muito dinheiro,"" e foi isso que os deixou doentes
Mas eu me pergunto como elas ainda não estão grávidas, deram várias vezes
Vocês apostam com essa merda fraca, eu sou orginal
Verdadeira puta de rua
Não será uma música se eu derramar sangue
Nós esta com a defesa
Faça o que fizer, mana, mantenha fofa, mana
Deixe essa merda pra lá ou vai ficar sem dentes
Eu fui verdadeira a minha vida toda eu comprei queimadores
Eu não compro gostos (Brr)
Como ela conseguiu todo esse dinheiro? Eles têm se perguntado
Essas vadias são loucas, essas vadias são despreziveis
Elas me provacam, e eu nem ligo
Aposto que se eu tivesse um pau, essas putinhas iria sofrer bastante

Sinto que sou o maior rapper que saiu do Sul (Quem quer fumar?)
E ela continua tentando dar, disse a ela: só boquete por enquanto (Oh, Deus)
Ela quer usar a bunda, disse a ela trabalhe só com a boca (Direto)
Todo mundo falando pra rei resolver na conversa
Mano nós atiramos, nós não discutimos (Vadia)
Mano mentiroso, você não está ganhando nenhun dinheiro
E nós não ligamos para o seu talento (Foda-se)
Vim da favela, agora eu sou multimilionário
Eu estava dormindo em cima de paletes (21)
Foda-se esses rappers, eu sou 4L gangue
Nós somos o melhor que nem o DJ khaled (Direto)
Tua vadia paga boquete louco igual um tweet do Kanye west (21)
Fiz um casamento para minhas Glocks, chame-os de Jay e Bey (21)
Eu divido o aluguel com meu fuzil
Porque ele fica comigo (Oh, Deus)
Deixo você atordoado que uma dose de licor
Não fique me seguindo (Oh, Deus)
Ele jogou uma bandeira branca, mas eu ainda quero treta (Estúpido)
Pego você no lançamento de seu álbum que você vai lançar com a Cardi B (Atire)
Faço essa pistola explodir nos dois jeitos
Eu chamo isso de Hennessy (Pow!)
Eu sei que sua mãe te ensinou a olhar para os dois lados antes de me cruzar (Putiane)

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got em mirrored
And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing...

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody
That will do ya how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Till you feel like you breathe for it
'Till you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
'Till it's got you gasping for air
And you lean for it
'Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it
I want it, promise I need that

Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance

His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, ""Thanks for the view"", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like ""boing!"" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

Can you feel it? Now it's coming back
We can steal it if we bridge this gap

When I lost it, yeah, you held my hand
But I tossed it, didn't understand
You were waiting as I dove into the waterfall

Well I'm just a boy with a broken toy
All lost and coy, at the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand, as a broken man
But I've found my friend at the curtains of the waterfall

Now I'm falling down, through the crashing sound
And you've come around at the curtains of the waterfall
And you rushed to me and it sets us free
So I fall to my knees at the curtains of the waterfall

So Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!

¿Cómo te llamas, bebé?
Un poco de mezcal me hace sentir pícara
Sé que no hablamos el mismo idioma
Pero dejaré que mi cuerpo hable por mí (Hable por mí)
Hola, me llamo Katy
Un poco de mezcal me hace sentir traviesa
Sé que no hablamos el mismo idioma
Pero dejaré que mi cuerpo hable por mí (Hable por mí)

[Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Con calma, yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese poom-poom, chica
Es un asesina, cuando baila quiere que to' el mundo la vea
Me gusta tu poom-poom, chica (Sube, sube)
Con calma, yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Mueve ese poom-poom, chica
Tiene adrenalina, en medio 'e la pista, vente, hazme lo que sea (¡Woo!)
Me gusta tu poom-poom, chica (¡Hey!)

[Verso 2: Katy Perry]
Me visto con mis chicas, a la caza esta noche
Presiento que cazaré a uno salvaje
Sé que normalmente no soy tu tipo
Pero nunca tuviste este tipo de estimulación
Todos los ojos están sobre mí cuando ilumino la habitación
Usa la vibra correcta y mi cuerpo se moverá
Fácil, bebé, veo que tienes ganas
Yo también

[Coro 2: Katy Perry]
Con calma
Veo que te encanta la manera en la que me muevo en la pista ahora

Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now

And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

I was riding ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T’s and dot my I’s or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin’ battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look

Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slippin'
Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you, ""Nigga, live your life and grow""
I'd tell you, ""Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 to the pipe and smoke""

Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck

Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (woo)

Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it

Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum
Put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless
Lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless
Largest in charge
And born in New Orleans
Get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely

Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Before the morning sun, when life was lonely

Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me

We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life

So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories

Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me

So if they see me drunk in this bar
It ain't over a broken heart

Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey

Cheers to a good country song
To another long work week gone
And, yeah, I'm raising my glass to those savin' our ass overseas
I might stay for one more round

A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves

But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce

I put carats on your hand
But see I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slipping at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; ¡wuh!)

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

My-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think

I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Verse 1]
Some people lie but they're looking for magic
Others are quietly going insane
I feel alive when I’m close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same

[Chorus 2]
I know I could lie, but I won't lie to you
Wherever I go, you're the ghost in the room
I don't even try looking for something new
Cause wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Verse 2]
Some people try but they can't find the magic
Others get down on their knees and they pray
I come alive when I’m close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

[Chorus]
I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you, you

I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

Bringing in money like raking in leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achoo, that was a blessing
She special to you, I don't look at her special
Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above, we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don't call me back ever
Passing through Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Broke and in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek
Jhené Aiko, chewing her cheeks
Groceries, please, you know that was me

Keep it strong in case anyone testing us
Right or wrong, if it's this, you don't mess with it
When yo' bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man, that's irregular
Take her phone, disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets, smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it
Carats, they glisten in all of my necklaces
Feeling myself, really thought it was evident

Remember young kids in the school used to laugh at him
Guess I played my numbers real good, check the mathematics
Niggas broke and Zoovie Zoo up, why they mad at him?
Man I bought about 12 cars just to blast past 'em

And my niece believe in Christmas
And her dad, somebody killed him
Some shit I don't remember
'Cause I left him in a box when they had me in them locks
I blame God for my convictions
Never give a judge that ammunition
Never had no codefendants
God gon' be my only witness
Never take it personal, it's whatever when we handling business
We been through the worst, them situations we can never mention
You gon' have your mom losing her mind if you get a conviction
Got some homies sitting in the feds, hope they get an eviction
Praying to his gun, he got his fire, he ain't got no religion
I heard Meek got 2 for a wheelie and I was in the kitchen serving Had me thinking is it all worth it?
Thinking 'bout the chances that I took to buy you purses
Thinking 'bout them licks that we went on and just go splurge it
Switched it up and everything been working",153337,2,0.18,0.515,0.802,0,0.241,-2.655,0.283,76.069,0.279

Una más
DJ Khaled

[Coro: Travis Scott]
Celebramos por los que perdimos, sí (Sí)
Celebramos con quienes llegamos aquí (Sí)
Le sacamos el dedo del medio a los que no están aquí (Ah, sí)
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido, sí
Celebramos con quienes llegamos aquí
Le sacamos el dedo del medio a los que no están aquí
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido

[Verso 1: Post Malone & DJ Khaled]
La gente tiende a perderla, te ven subir (Ah)
Y estabas hablando estupideces, desearías morderte la lengua (Sí)
Tu sangre está quemando butano, sé que te come
Y yo sigo moviéndome, esa envidia te tiene atrapado (Ah, sí)
Ahora imprimimos dinero y tú conduces un Jetta
Desde que te corté, juro que la vida es mejor (Uh)
Y nadie te cree, puedes decir lo que quieras
Sólo fiesta en Ibiza como nosotros (DJ Khaled)
Y nunca perdemos el sueño por ti (Por ti)
Y es por eso que vamos a dedicarle este brindis, brindis a ustedes
(Vamos)

[Coro: Travis Scott]
Celebramos por los que perdimos, sí (Sí)
Celebramos con quienes llegamos aquí (Sí)
Le sacamos el dedo del medio a los que no están aquí  (Ah, sí)
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido, sí
Celebramos con quienes llegamos aquí
Le sacamos el dedo del medio a los que no están aquí
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido

[Verso 2: Travis Scott & DJ Khaled]
En una camioneta Lambo, no es un Panorama
Aunque me fijé y por dentro tiene vista panorámica
[?], salimos de Atlanta
Cuando lo más cercano al trópico fue la Tropicana (Sí)
Gritando ""liberen a los chicos"", viertan uno para los chicos
Para mi amigo 50 en el otro lado
Dame una, dame dos, dame tres (Una más)

[Coro: Travis Scott]
Celebramos por los que perdimos, sí (Sí)
Celebramos con quienes llegamos aquí (Sí)
Le sacamos el dedo del medio a los que no están aquí  (Ah, sí)
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido, sí
Celebramos con quienes llegamos aquí
Dedo de el medio para quienes no están aquí
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido

[Interludio: Travis Scott]
(No hay amor perdido, no hay amor perdido, no hay amor perdido)
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido (No hay amor perdido, no hay amor perdido)
Uh (Sí), uh (Sí)
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido
(No hay amor perdido, no hay amor perdido, no hay amor perdido)

[Verso 3: Travis Scott & DJ Khaled]
Soy un hombre malo, sólo tengo cosas buenas
Soy de clase mundial, deja ver al barrio
He estado con eso
He sido selectivo con una gran bolsa moviéndose libremente
He estado con eso
(Vamos)

[Coro: Travis Scott]
Celebramos por los que perdimos, sí (Sí)
Celebramos con quienes llegamos aquí (Sí)
Le sacamos el dedo del medio a los que no están aquí  (Ah, sí)
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido, sí
Celebramos con quienes llegamos aquí
Le sacamos el dedo del medio a los que no están aquí
No hay amor, no hay amor perdido

The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling, looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

[Chorus 1]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, Spark, and Light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time

[Verse 2]
Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

[Chorus 2]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loco's, spark a light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

[Chorus 3]
When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

[Outro]
Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now

I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body
Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari (Rrr, woo)
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (Coupe)
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though (Sorry though)
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)
Yeah, they call me Cardi B
I run this shit like cardio
Woo, facts

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Diamond district in the chain, chain (I said I like it like that)
Certified, you know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang (I said I like it like—woo)
Drop the top and blow the brains, woo (Woo, I said I like it like that)
Oh, he's so handsome, what's his name? Yeah (Woo, bags, I said I like it)
Oh, I need the dollars, cha-ching (I said I like it like that)
Beat it up like piñatas (I said I like it like—; uh)
Tell the driver, close the curtains (I said I like it like that, skrrt)
Bad bitch make you nervous (I said I like it)
Cardi B

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
Chambean, chambean, pero no jalan (¡Jalan!)
Tú compras to'a las Jordan, bobo, a mí me las regalan (Jeje)
I spend in the club, what you have in the bank? (¡Wuh; ¡yeh!)
This is the new religion bang in Latino gang, gang, ¡yeh!
Trato de hacer dieta, pero es que en el closet tengo mucha grasa (¡Yeh!; ¡wuh!)
Ya mudé la' Gucci pa' dentro de casa, yeh (¡Wuh!)
Cabrón, a ti no te conocen ni en Plaza (No)
El Diablo me llama, pero Jesucristo me abraza (Amén)
Guerrero como Eddie, que viva la raza, yeh
Me gustan boricuas, me gustan cubanas
Me gusta el acento de las colombianas (¿Qué hubo pues?)
Como mueve el culo la dominicana (¿Qué lo que?)
Lo rico que me chingan las venezolanas (¡Wuh!)
Andamos activos, Perico Pin Pin (Wuh)
Billetes de cien en el maletín (¡Ching!)
Que retumbe el bajo, Bobby Valentín, yeh (¡Buh!)
Aquí es prohibido amar, diles, Charytín
Que pa'l picor les tengo Claritín
Yo llego a la disco y se forma el motín (¡Rrrah!)

[Chorus: Cardi B & Bad Bunny]
Diamond district in the chain (I said I like it like that)
Bad Bunny baby, bebé, bebé
Certified, you know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang (I said I like it like—woo)
Drop the top and blow the brains, woo (Woo, I said I like it like that)
Oh, he's so handsome, what's his name? Yeah (Woo, yeh, I said I like it)
Oh, I need the dollars, cha-ching (I said I like it like that)
Beat it up like piñatas (I said I like it like—)
Tell the driver, close the curtains (I said I like it like that, skrrt)
Bad bitch make you nervous (I said I like it, that)

[Verse 3: J Balvin]
Como Celia Cruz tengo el azúcar (Azúca')
Tu jeva me vio y se fue de pecho como Jimmy Snuka (Ah)
Te vamos a tumbar la peluca
Y arranca pa'l carajo, cabrón, que a ti no te vo'a pasar la hookah (Hookah, hookah)
Mis tenis Balenciaga me reciben en la entrada (Wuh)
Pa-Pa-Paparazzi like I'm Lady Gaga (Wuh)
Y no te me hagas (Eh)
Que en cover de Billboard tú has visto mi cara (Eh)
No salgo de tu mente (Wuh)
Donde quieras que viajes has escuchado ""Mi Gente""
Yo no soy hype, soy como el Testarossa (Hype; 'rossa)
Yo soy el que se la vive y también el que la goza (Goza, goza)
Es la cosa, mami es la cosa (Cosa, cosa)
El que mira sufre y el que toca goza (Goza, goza, goza)

[Bridge: J Balvin, Cardi B]
I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that (Rrr)
I said I like it like that (Woo)
I said I like it like that

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Diamond district in the chain (I said I like it like that)
Certified, you know I'm gang, gang (I said I like it like—)
Drop the top and blow the brains, woo (I said I like it like that)

Maybe you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

[Verse 1]
Stuck in a limbo, half hypnotized
Each time I let you stay the night, stay the night
Up in the morning, tangled in sheets
We play the moment on repeat, on repeat

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Maybe, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

I just, I just can't let you go
Give me something I've never known

So maybe you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

[Verse 2]
No need to question next time we meet
I know you’re coming home with me, home with me
Sweat like a sauna, break up the ice
I know you’re gonna stay the night, stay the night

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Maybe, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

I just, I just can't let you go
Give me something I've never known

So, maybe you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

[Bridge]
I don't want this to end
And there's no need to play pretend
If you stay with me again
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Maybe, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

I just, I just can't let you go
Give me something I've never known

Maybe, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place

Baby, you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just trying to drive it once again
Baby, you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just trying to drive it once again

[Verse 1: Wale]
Shawty, can I fill your tank, yeah?
I start off with that, ""what you drinkin'?""
Pardon if I'm road raging
But I know you heard my drive is crazy
Yeah, let me pace that with some patience
Let me do it till I fill every void
You're like a Maybach, thinking damn
They ain't even make 'em like you no more
It's like a high beam gleaming through your eye (bling)
I adore you up, baby suicide
A little wordplay, I'm hoping I can make you smile
Least until I'm out of line like a DUI
Girl, you remind me of my Jeep
Can I see what's up with that G-Wagon?
Can I take you off of these streets?
To the side of me, I'm trying to see your hazards
Trying to be with the baddest, won't be the fastest
Gotta make it last, I hope you comfortable
I need to get to you, you're like a '62
A little work then it's curtains when I'm skrrting through
Came through in the group, trying to leave in the coupe
That mean I gots a few, but I believe in you
Trying to chase the cat, know I'm killing it, dawg
You ain't feeling me naw, that mean I don't need the roof

[Bridge: Jeremih & Wale]
You remind me of my Jeep, I wanna ride it
You something like my car
I got the keys to them, I need the keys to you

[Pre-hook: Jeremih]
You put on a show, you don't need no clothes
Give me little bit more, always take it slow
I know you don't wanna stop, I'm trying to make it go

And I'm just trying to drive it once again

A good woman is scarce to us
And I wasn't prepared to love
I know it sound crazy, but your miles scare me
I'm just here cause your character good (truth be told)
A good nigga is rare to her (truth be told)
You heard it all, but hear this love
One night with dude, I be the reason you cool
So let me know am I clear enough, yeah, what's up?
Way I, way I, that's the way I think
Shawty straight like a concept on Bayonne Street
In the morning I slide over, she needs a ride I'm like
""Tight, let's keep it AMG""
Sliding down, precipitating is straight
Top down, let me kiss your physique
I'm digging your fleek, I'm checkin' your gear
Can tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet
She like when I drive it, I like it in park
Pull that thing over you likely to sore
I got her floating like riding on stars
So I keep it GPS, see where this going
Nothing will stop it, I slide in no prob
Ch-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts
Sex is her weapon, my snake in her garden
So know when I'm not here the viper is on

Hey girl, I’m just a small town run around
I get my kicks out on the outskirts of town
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
I’m more a fishin’ in the dark nitty gritty boy
So lay back and let me paint you a picture
The way I wanna kiss you is

[Chorus]
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night ‘til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that

[Verse 2]
When I’m with you I can see down the road girl
Not just the gravel one we’re travelin’ on girl
And I’m bettin’ that it’s gonna be a wild ride
But I promise that I’m gonna be there by your side
I think we got another memory in the makin’
So baby let’s take it, take it

It's butterflies and Bud Lights
Under the stars and on the stripes
Of a beach towel in a Spring Break town

Through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just living
That American country love song

[Chorus]
In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on and on and on

[Verse 3]
It's Chris loves Jenny on a license plate
It's daddy getting mad cause you came home late
It's one last kiss in the driveway
Hey, radio DJ can you play that song that she loves
So I can turn it up and maybe turn her on
An American country love song

[Chorus]
In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart

Cowboys and country girls, all around this small town world
To the same old pick up lines, we've tried a million times
All the bad and good as it gets
To the ones that you ain't met yet

In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart

Trap God, and we servin' out the hallway

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Fuck I need gold for man?)
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Fuck I need clothes for man?)
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow dat, baby
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)
Ayy, we gon' save that money
What we doin'? We gon' save dat money

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky & Fetty Wap]
The rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on 'em
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah, baby!)
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed (No)
Those margaritas not goin' on my card (No)
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
Hold up
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L the Jew biz major? (Ayy)
Fuck you know about the world he raised in?
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker 13
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday (It's true)
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away (It's true)
Book flight December but I leave in May (I do)
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get logins for Netflix from my cousin Greg
Thanks Greg!

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Yeah baby)
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Yeah baby)
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?

All of my luggage is Louie V, I swear to God, nigga
All of my bitches be scared of me, I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thoughtless, I disregardin' them
All of them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil' nigga somethin' like a preacher
I can take his ass to church fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burp like a baby without no hiccup
I could...

[Interlude: Lil Dicky]
Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know what a full verse would have been too expensive anyways
I think

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
Trap, trap, trap
I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie (Please)
Hair cut several months in-between, homie (Always)
Hit the mafuckin' lights when I leave, homie (YOLO)
Single ply TP, ass bleed
Airbnb the motherfuckin' lease, I'm never there
I'm out in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
At happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care
And that applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees, phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it (All the fam)
401K, rollin' over bands on it (Ayy)
Coppin' sweaters in the summer when the sale on 'em (I'm hot)
The fuck you rappers bragging 'bout? You overpaying for it

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Yeah baby)
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Yeah baby)
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I’m judicious)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I’m cost efficient)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I do it different)
What we do? We gon' save that money

[Verse 4: Lil Dicky]
I ain't never hit a bar with a cover (Never)
Low thread count, hard with the covers (Woo)
Free trial memberships, though
I never join the shiz though (Ayy)
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin' finch though (Brr)
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite a bit
Whatchu talkin' 'bout?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans though (Ayy)
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands, though (Ayy)
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo (Ayy)
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke (Ayy)
Check the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
My dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me, well I fuckin' don't!

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Yeah baby)
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Yeah baby)
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby

Every time these niggas tryna play
And lately I've been stackin' up crazy
Stackin' up 'cause all about the bands, baby
800K underneath the bed baby

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
If you at a restaurant and got a iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see he double charged ya
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing along like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't double charge me, we like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be (Brr)
So think about it, take a minute, let it breathe, B
But think about it, bruh, you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Versus the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter tryna tell me something different
I'ma get on Yelp in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that
You didn't even... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed",290836,2,0.114,0.858,0.697,0,0.224,-5.361,0.23,98.012,0.364

I've heard it so many times I can tell it
To the T, believe me I could sell it
All day
It goes...

[Chorus]
A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

[Verse 2]
I'd laugh too if my heart would let me
Keeping it light will probably help to get me
Over you
I'm walking, talking, drinking proof
A cliché in a corner booth
Ain't nothing new

Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me

Look see
Everybody hatin when i'm buzzin like a satellite givin off a wave
Ta the earth for the kids
That's TV
People wanna say, they wanna fight n get the kids all hype
Like a crowd in the night
No pg
A kid a doing it right you never knew me
But i'm coming around the corner kinda dark and no
Can't see me
I tryna to be the one who's always talkin, when i think and let it out n let it go like
Free weed

[Verse]

Sorry that i gotta be the one ta flip it off
But i told you ima king, so better think twice
Of lyin on a track while comin against me
I'm fiendin to give thoughts, don't plan to be nice
So i gotta give a hundred when i'm runnin
When i'm jumpin on a mic, ima say whats in my head
I don't care about the cost, i faught for the spot that i rock
Straight raw, home grown, I don't care if you talkin

Name up in your throat like coughin
No stoppin cuz i'm sick like your mom so often
I'm back up from the ground, like the dead, In a coffin
Got a bat wit a nickname, lucy, call it
Steppin in the game like look
Callin all these Mother f****** out on the truth, then the wallet
Ill be gettin what i want In the end quit stallin
I'm ready for the fun, I've been done, gonna run this

I don't wanna hear you f****** say, 'where i'm from b****  ?'
Its all up on google n now who the dumb b****
Lookin for a reason bro, for me to get dumb rich
So never am i done doin better by minute
When i'm lifted, I be gifted, when i gimmick
Wit the image like boss
I'm fully automatic, I'm n addict in the halls
Trippin like the days i was takin adderall n i'm talkin kid days
Sorry had to do it mom
Said i had to focus everyday when i was young
Took it to level now look what i become
Kxng jay, don't play
Everyday ima in the lab wit ammunition for the punks

Still pickin around the world, tell the rats from snakes
Dumb stickin around ta see how it ends aye
Livin in Atlanta full of graves n dealin wit allizeh
A holy legend fading the hell away
I met him downtown i should have known tho
Atlanta try to play you in a sick way
Be ready for the set up you gon get played
By every mother f***** that's the broke way
Learned first hand two years wit paid slots
Don't be tryna play the artist workin harder then your pops
From the 50's n 60's respect me or not
Cuz the time within my life is all i got
I took shot. My aim is good
You better watch from the city ta hoods
I'm telling these kids, If you dream then its good n to follow that s***, when you know that you should

Jay back like a tic
I'm buggin, I'm gettin pissed
Working this really hard n nobody see how lit
It's really gonna be the minute we hit a shift
N everybody lookin be patient i'm comin big, wit the steps now
Walkin the road slow I keep cool now, ooh wow
How he spittin venom, I gettin em n never sweat it
Don't forget it, make em get it like a dube cloud
Prouder then a mother f**** spittin all the truth out

Never playing wit the 808's, I don't plan ta get away
Until the day i got to, when it come I'm gonna make way
Pirate wit the life, only tryna make the dope bay
Paddle wit the raft in the tide, ain't a joke aye
We gonna get a bottle gonna chill up in the sand
Got da brother in boat n he goin full throttle
Jay up on the finger tip, baby girls fishin
Please just hear, when you do start bloggin

Aye, lemme slow this up
Lemme say this clear, for the stupid f****
Wit a slow mind, a homie had enough
But ima say this once in case you do respond
If you wanna hear what i gotta say
Wit so many words i can do that
Its only three words, said back ta back
Its 'YOU ARE A B****', so learn to read fast
Had so many years ta learn here
But lemme be clear, you'll burn here
I'm up in the world, its my work yeh
I'm gonna get what i deserve b****
Until ima corpse in the floor near
A bag full of weed buried under a stage wit the mic in my hand
Cuz ill never change, i'm climbin this game its my turn yeh

But when i get attackin, i'm taggin, i'm gonna drag em
When they rappin, when i say its gonna happen, Its gon happen
Ain't no question on the matter, i'm handle all the hatters

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence""",248467,6,0.468,0.322,0.28,1.1e-6,0.102,-9.367,0.0281,85.794,0.175

Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year

[Verse 2]
I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year

[Verse 3]
Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

Are poundin' on this heart of mine

[Intro: Big Sean]
They used to tell me, used to tell me

[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, ""Ain't too much that's different""
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

[Hook: Kanye West]
And I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, one man could change the world
One man could change the world

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My grandma told me, ""If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white out""
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...

[Hook: John Legend]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

[Verse 1]
But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like oh well
You're like, ""Fuck it. Oh well""

Okay I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things you can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more Henny and you're past the limit
You told me 'bout the picture, now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy

Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
